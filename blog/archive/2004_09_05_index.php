          You know, I feel like this presidential election in November is tearing people apart faster than a Cable connection to the internet. I have never in my lifetime seen people so on edge about such a topic. Why? Well, its simple, its not about being 'democratic' or 'republican'...oh no...its a much bigger picture that people don't want to see.<br /><br />This is about ideologies. See, you're either on one side or you're on the other and here are the two sides: Science and Faith. They are both fine I guess, and usually can live in harmony, but the problem with the presidential election is that the reason that people are voting for one candidate or another is a moral decision. These morals are based on very structured ideologies that have existed for thousands of years. What is happening here is that on both sides people are screaming back and forth because the other side (naturally) challenges their ideology, or to be so frank, purpose in life. You can't tell someone to their face that God doesn't exist. You can't walk up to someone and tell them that their religion is a joke. You can't just walk up to somebody, take off their turban, and start stomping it. Not here. Not in America.<br /><br />On the other hand, no matter how much you know about faith and how many prophecies have shown validity over the thousands of years, you can't walk up to someone and tell them that "gravity doesn't exist, it is God holding each and everyone of us down to Earth". That's clearly not scientific. While I can't prove to you that it ISN'T God holding me down to the Earth, I cannot and will not attempt to understand your logic of thought.<br /><br />So, we have two sides: Science and Faith. Both sides are very powerful and have a very large base (and there are some anomalies in the middle, but let's keep this simple). Now, I see that people <span style="font-style:italic;">say</span> they don't want to talk about it-- try to dodge the subject and yet they really DO want to talk about it. Well...this Presidential Election has caused enough trouble and now I am going to offer a solution-- and as a true democracy we should be able to vote this in and put into effect. Ok, brace yourself.<br /><br />Instead of having a National {$Party_Name} Convention they should be training. Get on a treadmill everyday, learn how to box, Kung-Fu, or whathaveyou. Then, in November when we would normally be voting, we sit at home in front of our TVs which shows a circular dirt road (kind of like a loop). Then the gun goes off and the two presidential candidates ride off on chariots and race around the loop. Whoever wins the race first (or remains alive) is appointed president.<center><img src="http://www.devlogik.com/www/E3R_2/blog/benhur.jpg" /></center>So there we have it people, thats my solution. Start writing promo letters to your Senator........now.<br />

          Alright... SO, i'm driving through McDonalds because I love their new Chicken Selects with Spicy Buffalo Sauce... and i'm all SUPER DUPER excited (if any of you have ever had these, you would totally understand) and I get my food, and then she hands me my drink and DROPS IT ON MY LAP! Now, we all understand that the girl in the window made a mistake however, she never appologized... in fact, she pretended it didn't happen and just closed her little window and walked away... leaving me soaked in coke. I was madder than a legless etheopian watching a donut roll down a hill.<br /><br />alright, that is all... i just needed to bitch about it<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><strong>*disclaimer*</strong><br />this does not ruin my love for McDonalds. nothing could ever destroy that bond.. it's the deffinition of unconditional.</span><br /><br />

          Hey guys, this is Kevin, and I'm posting under a new name now, to represent my drastic change in ideologies.  I love the Left!  Michael Moore is the man, GW sucks.  While I do love Kerry, I think he could stand to be a little more liberal.  All the GOP does is start wars and give money to the rich, at the expense of everyone else.<br /><br />

          I've been gone because I have been trying to figure out how to reformat my computer. Holy crap is it more complicated than just putting in the disk and letting windows do it's thing. Took me weeks to figure out how to get my internet up and running again. After installing the NIC drivers I had to search through random things to manually install. My computer is still a little slower than it should be, but since it's working and I only got it running again by accident I'll leave it as is.<br /><br />I also made a trip out to California in the Santa Rosa area. It was good times. My cousin got married and the trip was pretty much a 72 hour party... I took one break to sleep and pretty much jumped right back in. Looks like I missed a lot so I should get reading. Oh, and hiya Abbmasta. (not sure if i'm allowed to call you by your real name but abbmasta is cooler anyway)<br /><br />

Otherwise, I'm going to continue to post my opinions about things. I don't believe anything I've said until now has been particularly harmful to anyone (I've clarified that I harbor no ill feelings towards Tuuk and he is a hell of a smart guy, and I still believe that Bush is a smart man... I just think that most other presidents have been smarter is all). And I don't think that defending my opinions against an Anonymous poster should qualify as harmful either. If you don't want to read this stuff, you don't have to, but don't tell me to post something new when you aren't posting anything at all.<br /><br />P.S.: I suppose you weren't whining over the whole "people are stealing my identity" issue?<br /><br />

          So Tuuk has pointed out that college (or any other post-high school education) does not define intelligence. There are plenty of dumbasses who are admitted to (and do well in) all sorts of colleges; likewise, there are plenty of people like Tuuk who are highly intelligent without having had the benefit of higher education. The reason I had pointed out Bush's academic record, was because I already <a href="http://media.ebaumsworld.com/index.php?e=sovereignity.mov">don't think he's the smartest president we've ever had</a>, and his academic record does not help to dissuade me. I mean, he's not the dumbest person in the world, but he's the president. Oh, and I realize that I just said that his academic record "does not define intelligence," it's certainly some sort of indicator of his performance. And Tuuk, again, please take no offense at this, you've already proved that you are very intelligent; but you have to admit, that you, along with Lincoln and the rest, are somewhat atypical cases.<br /><br />In response to Anonymous poster's comment, "If you are voting Third then why the hell would you only trash one of the three candidates when you should do both since you are voting third..... you logic is chaos.": Actually, I guess I never realized that if you consider one of the candidates to be the best, that you have to hate the others equally... oh, wait, that's because it doesn't make sense. This is like saying that in the Olympics, there should be one Gold medal winner and two Bronze in a competition. If I wasn't voting for a Third party candidate, then I would vote for one of the other two, the "Silver medalist," instead of no one. And I can say that I think Bush isn't too bright without having to say that Kerry isn't either because I am NOT Bill O'Reilly, and I don't claim to be "Fair and Balanced."<br /><br />That's enough for now.  Time for band practice!  Oh, and Tuuk, those bass books are probably mine.  You sneaky son-of-a-bitch.<br /><br />

          Well I got a nasty little bug on my box. I got a 250GB HDD over the weekend. I did a fresh install of my OS and somewhere between updating my drivers and installing Norton, I got a malicious little pest. It hijacked my browser and did blanket domain blocks on all of the virus and spyware killer sites. I finally had to go around the backdoor to cnet and get adaware... Bug found, solved, but good God what a fucking pisser. So my quesitons is, do these companies that hijack browsers and flood you with their ads, really in their minds think that after pissing me off so badly, I will even think about buying a fucking thing from them? It really is out of hand. Think about it, there is an entire industry of ANTI spyware programs that is now thriving. It is going to get to the point, where making laws to STOP these OS hijackers will be worse as it will put people like Lavasoft out of business. How sick is that!<br /><br />

          First of all, Tuuk, your post was... a bit long. <br /><br />Secondly, with regards to your comment about my beef with GW going to Yale and myself not being accepted to Virginia Tech:  I just don't like that nepotism was the deciding factor in his acceptance and not his own merits.  You'd think that someone who will eventually be president could get into college on his own or something... I don't know, it's disappointing.  Would I take advantage of the same situation if given the chance?  Yes I would.  But the issue I have here is this (and keep in mind, I really don't know too much about how Yale is funded; if it is completely funded by private means, they are excluded from this):  There is no logical reason why I should have to pay a proportionately equal amount of money to a state-funded university (such as Virginia Tech) when I have a less-than-equal chance of being admitted... which means that no one should be given that "leg up" birthright oppurtunity.<br /><br />Thirdly, I never said I was voting for Kerry, nor did I ever imply that I wouldn't vote for Bush simply because I'm jealous of his getting into Yale.  I believe that I said I would vote for Justice.  And by justice I mean not Kerry.  And also, not Bush.  That's right, Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik is getting my vote, probably.  Zing!  Maybe he isn't the Personification of Justice, but I'm sure he's an alright guy.<br /><br />And as a sidenote, I am definitely not voting for Kerry because he supports the platform of affirmative action, AKA reverse discrimination.  I don't feel very strongly about many issues, but this one happens to be one of the ones that I do have an opinon on.  If anybody thinks that this platform is a good idea, please comment or post.  I'm interested to know if you guys really think it's a good idea or are just willing to bear it if it means that Bush is out of office.<br /><br />

          The more I look into this, the sicker it makes me! Virginia Tech has an entire department dedicated to non discrimination. But their admission policiies themselves justify denying entrance to non minorities based on the fact that they were born who they are.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discriminations.us/storage/001992.html">http://www.discriminations.us/storage/001992.html</a><br /><a href="http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/april2.html">http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/april2.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.eoaa.vt.edu/">http://www.eoaa.vt.edu/</a><br /><br />

          Okay, I have been biting my lip constantly, I have held myself back, but a post on here really has me pissed off about the problems we have and the perceptions people have as to why they are there.<br /><br />Bush goes to Yale, I get rejected by Virginia Tech.<br /><br />The irony in that post amazes me! You are getting pissed off at Bush for taking advantage of something that you can not deny you yourself would take advantage of. I suggest you direct your anger at VT and laws that were written by the Democratically controlled Congress under their 62 year reign of power that has strongarmed and blackmailed these schools into policies that are now more than likely keeping you out. I can almost guarantee you that a countless number of minorities who carried a much lower GPA and SAT score have been admitted at your cost.<br /><br />I AM NOT SAYING ALL MINORITIES THAT ARE AT VT, OR ANY OTHER COLLEGE ARE IN THIS CLASSIFICATION, SO DON'T EVEN TRY TO GO THERE! ALL WHO KNOW ME HERE, KNOW I HAVE NOT A SINGLE RACIST BONE IN MY BODY!<br /><br />The fact of the matter though is that is does happen. Personally, I am fed up with it! It in itself is racist, it is reverse racism, and it is illegal by our own Constitution. And don't give me any shit about fucking reperations. I have NEVER in my life oppressed ANYONE, and I have been just as poor as most! Has anyone here ever oppressed anyone? Should you be punished for things that happened long before you were even fucking born? How can anyone say there is justice and equality when so many are denied, and so many are recieving based simply on the fact they were born of a certain race. Is this not exactly the thing that King and the many that died were trying to stop?<br /><br />I would suggest to you that Democrats who dreamed up and passed these laws did so out of their own guilt for their own misdeeds. Democrats like Senator Byrd, Senator for life from West Virginia, who was once a member of the KKK. Democrats after all were against the liberation of the slaves. The Republican party was created because of ONE ISSUE ALONE! The Republicans believed the new territories in the West should be free states. Their was a rift in the Whig Party and the Party split, giving birth to Republicans. The first elected Republican President went to war against the Democrat South to stop their succession and went on to write one of the greatest documents of human rights ever drawn up, the Emancipation Proclamation. The second Republican President, General Grant, who led the Union Army to victory had an anti slave message as part of his platform, and furthermore tried to stop othe just formed Knights of the Klu Klux Klan.<br /><br />It was the Republicans in the 1960's who wrote and submitted to the President the Civil Rights Amendment which gave ALL Americans the right to vote, and it was Democrats from the South that perpetrated the longest fillibuster in history to try and stop it from passing. As a matter of fact, it was a certain Senator from South Carolina named Strom Thurmond that stood before Congress for over 12 hours in this fillibuster. Mr. Thurmond at the time was a life long Democrat and one time candidate for President who later on, as a REFORMED racist, denounced racism, the Democratic Party, and switched sides becoming a member of the Party of Lincoln. I remember I was watching MTV in 1992, they had of all people, Chuck D of Public Enemy covering the Republican National Convention. Chuck came across Strom and pointedly asked him how it is that he is no longer a racist. Strom very matter of factly said that when he was raised in South Carolina, that is what he knew, it was bred into him, it was taught to him, he was ignorant. He said as he got older, as he came to be a Senator, over the years through his dealing with people, his ignorance was more or less washed away, truth he said is hard to ignore when is is slapping you in the face. Chuck D was pretty much dumbfounded. He shook Mr. Thurmonds hand and walked away. I imagin Kurt Loder and Tabitha Sorenson up in the booth were faily miffed, as this "confrontation", designed to help their candidate, Mr. Billy Boy Clinton, had just blown up in their faces.<br /><br />If you look back at your history, it was then Democrat Governor of Alabama, George Wallace who stood before the doors of the school, refusing to let "the negros" through the door, over his dead body. Wallace went on to become a Democratic Candidate for President three times. It was in his last bid that he was shot by would be assassin Arthur Bremer, in PG County, MD. The bullet left Wallace paralyzed from the waist down and obviously left him replaying choices he had made in his life. Wallace was elected for his last term as the Governor of Alabama in 1982, by this time he was a changed man by all reasonable accounts. In 1995 the man who had once preached "Segrataion now, segragation forever" sat on a podium at the thirtieth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s march from Selma to Washington a changed man, thanking all attending for the "forgivness" they had given him.<br /><br />I only write all of this because I am sick of all the bullshit the media, the music, the movies, and our teachers feed us with this revisionist crap, never through any facts, but constant insinuations that the ones who were created on the platform of equality, and the ones who have demanded equality FOR ALL many times since are the ones responsible and the ones who are the racists today.<br /><br />Bill Cosby was right earlier this year when as a speaker at the NAACP Convention, he lambasted the attendees. In his words, he told them that their problems are their own, in the way they raise their children, in the way they run their lives, and like President Bush this year, he asked them how it is they can support the Democratic Party, unconditionally. "They know you are going to vote for them, you give them no competition, so how can you expect they will do anything for you, and what have they really doen for you anyway?"<br /><br />Why is it when Democrats are running for election, they suddenly start acting like Conservatives? Is it maybe because they know the majority of people really do have Conservative values, even though the media makes it out to be otherwise. Hollywood likes to run their mouths, but their lives are all fucked. What do they do for a living? They read lines. Their divorce rates are a joke, their kids are all fucked up, their lives in genreal would be in the shitter if not for the money we give them for making their movies. They are entertainers, and that is it, no more, no less, they are the Court Jester. I really don't give a fuck what Eddie Vedder thinks about anything, if not for a chance encounter that a guitarist mailed a tape to him, he would be more or less homeless. Instead, he stands on a stage, preaching to the rest of us, the ones who work to make the world better, feeding us his garbage opinion. Holding a guitar made from Brazilian Rosewood, cut out of trees in the Rainforest, he hipocritically tells you and I we should be guilty for our lives.... Fuck all of them.....<br /><br />How many of you honestly have taken the time to research history on your own, as opposed to blindly believing what your professors tell you. Just because they are professors does not mean they know what they are talking about either. You can get pissed at Bush, or maybe think for yourselves, look into the policies that have been passed that are keeping you out of the school you want to go to Kevin. Then cast your vote accordingly. Don't simply vote for Jim Moran, or John Kerry, because they tell you they are for you. The proof is in the pudding, look at their voting records and then decide who is for the people and who is for that "Other America" the America where Kerry's wife Mrs. Heinz spends all of her inherited money. Money that coincidentally was earned from scratch by the family of her late REPUBLICAN husband... Heinz.... Ever hear of them?<br /><br />Furthermore, now that I have opened this can of worms, in 6 days we will all remember the events of the morning of September 11th. You can listen to the likes of Michael Moore and his bullshit movie that is little more than slick editing, clever subtitles, clever timeline editing, and what amounts to pathetic knee bone connected to the thigh bone theories, or you can look at the facts. For Mr. Moore, I won't even waste typing, here is a website that gives a much more concise view on Mr. Moore's movies. <a href="http://www.bowlingfortruth.com">http://www.bowlingfortruth.com</a> This website is of course created by a BIASED Conservative, but that does not take an ounce of weight from the facts it lays out. <a href="http://bowlingfortruth.com/"></a>If anyone here has any education in advertising, it is plain to see that Moore is nothing but a salesman, and a very good one at that. He is as good as any ad exec at telling you his product is new and improved when in the end, it is still plain old aspirin.<br /><br />John Kerry says he will protect us. Really? Well lets look at Mr. Kerry's voting record when it comes to Defense and Intelligence. The places where the failures took place that gave these animals the oppurtunity to kill 3000 of your fellow Americans right before your very eyes. I am not going to even touch his supposed military career, I will leave that with this statement. Actually, fuck that, I am writing, so why stop now! Kerry hand picked 13 men to stand by him and call him a hero. We are supposed to take the word of these 13 men because they were there. At the same time, 264 men that were also there, say he is lying. But we are supposed to not listen to these men for some reason. These men are all decorated veterans themselves, and even if you were to prove that half of them are lying through their fucking teeth, that still leave well ove a hundred decorated veterans that say he is lying. I don't know, but if I am an attorney in court, I am hearing bells in my head right about now. When something smells fishy, many times there is something to it. Simply put, if John Kerry expects us to believe him, how many people does that mean are lying? In all honesty, this wouldn't really be such a big issue except for a few reasons. He brought it up as the centerpiece of his candidacy. He laid himself out there to be a war hero, a great person to lead our country in the fight against terrorism.<br /><br />They say that John Kerry spent most of his FOUR WHOLE MONTHS in Vietnam, writing "big fish" stories in his journal, "building" himself a "John Wayne" persona to take home with him. There are quite a few questions as to whether Purple Hearts one and three of the three he recieved were from enemy fire, or his own fuck up with two seperate grenades he was playing around with. Furthermore, of the three Purple Hearts he recieved. NONE of them required anymore than a band aid and NONE of them required him to miss a single hour of duty.<br /><br />He was turned down initially for his request of these medals. That in itself is a red flag. Soldiers do not request their own medals, and they are never GIVEN these medals. They earn them and they are the RECPIENTS of them. Furthermore, on his site, he lists his Silver Star as having a V for Valor attached. This in itself is a lie as the V for Valor is not issued on a Silver Star as the Silver Star in itself defines valor. To further embellish it with a V would be redundant. Hmm! My grandfather recieved that medal for being shot down over Corrigador, enduring the 300 mile Bataan Death March with no food or water, and 2 1/2 years in a Japanese prison camp. But hey, don't take my word for it, it is in the Navy Regulations in which each medal that can be embellished with a V is listed, the Silver Star is NOT one of them. Are we seeing a pattern here? This brings up another question. How did that V get listed on this document Kerry had released and posted on his website detailing his noble service. If it is a forgery, a crime the Navy takes VERY seriously. They can, will, and have put even officers in the brig for extended stays. It violates he military code of conduct. It is an honesty issue they do NOT tolerate.<br /><br />We are told as I said before that we are to believe the 13 and not the 264. Kerry used a picture of him and 19 others that was taken in Vietnam. Of the 19, two are dead, one supports Kerry, and the rest demanded he stop using it. At the end of the day though, John Kerry can clear this all up by signing Form-180. One signature and his FULL military records would be released. He has managed to sign off on partial disclosures on seven other occasions, releasing selected records that bolster his case. It would seem to me that if I was this great war hero, and ANYONE questioned my service, I would sign a hundred of those things just so I could prve myself and say fuck you to anyone who had questioned me. He would also gain a lot of leverage in his campaign, by proving these veterans as liars, who would recieve the added benefit of doubt on any other accusations that he is lying on any other subject. But Kerry will not sign this form. I wonder why? Maybe a sliver of metal in your arm, or shrapnel in your ass isn't the wounds he wants people to know about. Especially if they were caused by his own goofing off. I tell you what, we can all make it very easy for Kerry. Go here and print out Standard Form-180. Take it to a campaign event, and tell him that you know he is very easy, so you as a good citizen will help him out. Ask him to sign that document and tell you will send it in for him.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.archives.gov/research_room/obtain_copies/standard_form_180.pdf">http://www.archives.gov/research_room/obtain_copies/standard_form_180.pdf</a><br /><br />Well one of the 264 that oppose Kerry, one of the creators of the current movement is himself a veteran. As a matter of fact, he was not only there, but when Kerry left, he took over Kerry's boat. He was a commander, he recieved two bronze stars, he was himself wounded, and when he returned to America, he was disgusted to see none other than John Kerry himself on television, in front of the Senate, accusing his fellow soldiers of atrocities against the Vietnamese. Kerry has blatantly said these men were baby killers, they burned down villiages, killed animals, and even cut off heads. He was cool though, he lumped himself in there too. When arriving back in America and seeing this, he was digusted to the point that he even appeared in the Dick Cavett Show to debate Kerry one on one. Some suggested that the Nixon administration put him up to it, even if this was the case, SO WHAT. The truth of the matter is that he paid his own plane ticket and lodging to tell his own story and stop Kerry from slandering his fellow veterans. He remarked that it always bothered him that when he called Kerry a liar on National television, that Kerry just shrugged it off, very much unlike a man who was telling the truth, there was no anger. He went home and left it be, he put the war behind him. Kerry ran for many a Senate campaign and he just kept his mouth shut. That is until last year when he was literally lying in a hospital bed recovering from surgery after giving his wife a kidney. Yes giving his wife a kidney! He was lying there and he saw Kerry trying to feed us all his John Wayne persona and decided enough was enough. Now explain to me exactly how it is that this man does not deserve the same respect and voice as Kerry? Or why the other 263 do not for that matter. Kerry has for the most part backed off of those lies, but he has never apologized. In doin what he did, he helped to break the morale of his brothers who were still there, and he energized Vietcong, causing more deaths, and more suffering for those who were in prison camps there.<br /><br />In 1984, John Kerry stood on the floor of the US Senate, slamming his fist on a table, making a speech against Reagan's request for funding for the rebels in El Salvador and Nicaragua as they tried to overthrow the Communist Sandinistas that were slaughtering people by the hundreds for simply wanting to live free. Of which I have family members who fled there so their 13 year old son would not be drafted to fight against his own friends and family members. That is slightly different than the story the American media gives. Why is this important? Well here is a direct quote from the speech. Actually, here are the minutes and the quote!<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">132 Cong.Rec. S3564-02<br />AMENDMENT NO. 1718<br />(Purpose: To restrict assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance to<br />humanitarian assistance, and for other purposes)<br />**************<br />The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.<br />Mr. KERRY. Thank you, Mr. President.<br />************** </span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Finally, President Nixon, 1970. "In cooperation with the armed forces of South Vietnam, attacks are being launched this week to clear out major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian-Vietnam border."<br /><br />"Mr. President, I remember Christmas of 1968 sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and have the President of the United States telling the American people that I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia.<br />I have that memory which is seared-seared-in me, that says to me, before we send another generation into harm's way we have a responsibility in the U.S. Senate to go the last step, to make the best effort possible in order to avoid that kind of conflict."</span><br /><br />Now what is the importance of this? Kerry has maintained for many years that this single incident is where and when he decided when it is ok for a president to take us into battle, and when it is not. He was very bitter at Nixon for "secretly" haveing him in Cambodia. In other words, Kerry's view on the Presidency and War is entirely predicated on a lie he made up in his own mind. Kerry Was not in Cambodia on Christmas of 1968. If Kerry would have checked his facts before he made up this story, he would have known that first off, NIXON WAS NOT EVEN PRESIDENT ON CHRISTMAS OF 1968! In his zealousness to lie, he used a former Republican President to try and squash the request of the present Republican President, and stuck his foot in his mouth. Kerry's journal, the METICULOUSLY kept journal does not mention Cambodia. Kerry was at least 50 miles away from the Cambodian border on Christmas of 1968. When confronted with this 2 months ago, there was a non answer given by his campaign. "the quote was mispoken". Really? Well that is funny because the first time he spoke of this was in an article he himself wrote in 1979 for the Boston Globe. He has spoken of it six times since 1984, including last year in an interview with the Washington Post. There is a funny bit on the Post story that is even more enlightening. In the interview, the women speaking to him asks him about a "secret compartment" in his briefcase. Kerry says "how did you know about that? Not even my friends know about that" Kerry proceeded to open the "secret compartment" and pull out a tattered military hat from Vietnam as he explained to her that the briefcase was a "gift", given to him by the CIA for his "secret work" in Cambodia on that Christmas of 1968 in Cambodia. Kerry made the entire story up, then the reporter acting on a "tip", more like a planted question, asks him the question, which gives him an opportunity to further embellish his lie about his Christmas in Cambodia. This story has been used for 20 years as Democrat lore to rail against the likes of the CIA and take down protections that may have prevented 911... Hint hint... the Dead Kennedy's even wrote a song.. Holiday in Cambodia... HMM!!!!<br /><br />So the importance here is that Kerry want us to believe he is the candidate to protect us. Kerry was for the war in Iraq, he was quoted MANY MANY times as being fully behind it even if we never found weapons of mass destruction. Weapons we know Saddam had because A) We gave him some of them. and B) The UN found 4000 liters of Anthrax their in 92 that has since disappeared. You want to be scared? Remember it was less than a gram that made it out of the envelope in the Brentwood Post Office in DC, three years ago that killed two people. 4000 Liters! Think 2000 two Liter bottles filled with the shit, and we don't know where Saddam hid the shit. Personally, the fact that 50 million people are closer to freedom than they have ever been in their life is justification enough for our attack on Iraq. Kerry said that "left to himself, Saddam posed a greater and greater threat to American safety" He said this as early back as October of last year. His running mate John Edwards is on the Senate Intelligence Commitee. He was privy to all the information anyone else had. And Edwards too voted FOR war against Iraq. Now they say otherwise. Now they are complaining that our troops are underfunded, when it was them that voted against 87 million dollars in funding for our military LAST YEAR!<br /><br />Here is the bottom line folks. Contrary to what the movies say, the government is not filled with politicians and generals who want to play with their military toys. Their job is to protect us. NONE OF US WANTS TO FUCKING GO TO WAR! Do you hear the insanity in suggesting we do? Are we all so pathetic that we have forgotten the horror we witnessed that day? That is not melodramatic, that is a fucking fact of life. Right now, there is a segment of the world from Germany to France, to Indonesia, to Africa, to the Middle East that have created something new. ISLAMIC FASCISM! They want to kill you because you are alive, because you are free, because your women are equal, because you live in a society that says you don't have to be religious if you don't want to. THEY WANT YOU DEAD! John Kerry has suggested we use diplomacy, we use understanding. THEY WANT YOU DEAD! They don't want to fucking talk to you. We fucking funded Osama Bin Laden and trained the Taliban in the 80's to help them to defeat the invading Communist Soviet Union in the 80's. We armed, funded, and trained Iraq in their war against Iran. We tried being nice, understanding, and helpful. It didn't work. There are many in the Middle East who want peace and freedom, who want to be our allies. Iraq and Afghanistan is the starting point. They will both be holding the first free elections in decades within the next 6 months because of us. By the games the media and the Democratic party are playing for the simple fact that they want to have political power, they are undermining this process and the dreams of a people. WE ALL TAKE OUR FREEDOM FOR GRANTED!<br /><br />Here is Kerry's record on our defense! These are taken from Roll Call and are part of the historical record.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">HE SAID CHECK THE RECORD<br />Sen. John Kerry, Democrat from Massachusetts says he is the strongest Presidential Candidate on National Defense ! He said Check the Record..<br />We Did !<br />Here is what we learned: </span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;"></span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to kill the Bradley Fighting Vehicle</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to kill the M-1 Abrams Tank-The most advanced tank in the world. Nothing even compares to it.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to kill every Aircraft carrier laid down from 1988-Speaks for itself.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to kill the Aegis anti aircraft system-Protects or ships from attack.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the F-15 strike eagle-The plane that screamed through the skies on 911 making sure no other terrorist plane could finish their task.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the Block 60 F-16</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the P-3 Orion upgrade-The AWACS planes that are CRUCIAL to coordinating our defenses.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the B-1</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the B-2</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the Patriot anti Missile system-The missile battery that stands watch over our skies.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the FA-18</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the B-2 </span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to Kill the F117</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">He voted to kill every military appropriation for the development and deployment of every weapons systems since 1988, including a bill for battle armor for our troops. If he had his way by virtue of his vote, we would be lagging poorly behind the rest of the world, and very vulnerable.<br /></span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is most likely, with Sen. John Kerry as President and Commander in Chief of our Armed Services, that they will cease to function making it impossible for our country to protect itself. John Kerry voted to kill all anti-terrorism activities of each and every agency of the U.S. Government. Now he wants to point fingers at others for the failure on 911.</span><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;"><br />He voted to cut the funding of the FBI by 60%. He voted to cut the funding for the CIA by 80%. He voted to cut the funding for the NSA by 80%. THEN, and this is abhorrent to almost every American Voter be you Democrat, Republican or Independent, he voted to increase OUR funding for U.N operations by 800% !! Ask yourself Is THIS the person you want as President of these United States to provide for the Common Defense of the Nation and to be the Leader of the Free W orld? Yes we are the leaders, like it or not, we are the remaining Superpower. I get sick of hearing the elites in the media telling us that the world hates us. Well if the world hates us so much, why are their citizens clamoring to get over our borders. Simply put, we are a beacon of light, we are free. We do not build our military for the sole purpose of waging war, we build it also as a deterent to war. War is a bloody mess. General Robert E Leeonce said "it is a good thing that war is so horrible, so that we may not grow too fond of it".<br /><br />Voting history can be accessed through Senate voting records and through Roll Call. The above is an accurate summary.<br /></span><br />The Democrats and their friends in Hollywood have been running around for years scaring you with stories and movies about the Evil CIA and the Evil Military so that they can get support to cut funding and divert those dollars to their pet socialistic welfare programs. Now when we get caught with our pants down on 911, they want to point fingers at the very people they helped tear apart. Sorry, the record speaks for itself!<br /><br />As I said, none of us want to go to war. Democrat Harry Truman was asked in his later days if he had to do it all over again, knowing the death and destruction he caused, would he drop the bombs on Japan again. He said emphatcially yes. It was estimated that a million Americans would die taking the island of Japan. We did not start that war, we did everything we could to stay out of it. This was very wrong in retrospect when we think of the slaughter the Nazis perpetrated. And in dropping those two bombs, we probably guaranteed we would never drop them again. That is the way our President needs to think. We live in a world of dangerous neighborhoods, unfortunately even if our house is good, we still live in this world. It is from the sheer dominance of our military and the weapons mentioned above that insure we do not have to wage a defense of ourselves. Even with this, we still find conflict. Kerry, as opposed to his Democrat counterparts of WWII has said he would let the UN decide when war was needed. Well we tried that, we watched the UN give Saddam 19 last chances. We even watched the UN vote UNANIMOUSLY on a final resolution giving him 30 days. When Kerry says this, I am worried. I will not leave the decisions of this nation in the hands of France, Germany, and Russia, especially when I see how they will watch people in Iraq suffer as they make millions with illegal contracts with the very leader we were trying to oust. No wonder they were against it. And FUCK FRANCE for that matter. We have 60,000 American bodies buried there from WWII because the only damn word in their vocabulary seems to be "We Surrender", and we gave the lives of another 58,000 Americans in Vietnam cleaning up the fucking mess they made after they abandonded their fucking colonies. It is no wonder the governing council in Iraq wants nothing to do with them. The Iraqi's know who worked against them, who lengthened their suffering. Michael Moore conveniently forgets this. I wonder if that has anything to with his film being reviewed and eventually winning at Cannes? No of course not! Not to mention France has refused to extradict director Roman Polanski who made such great movies as Chinatown and The Pianist. Why does this bother me if they are great movies? Well Mr. Polanski plead guilty to molesting, pardon me, RAPING a 13 year old girl in 1978. He comvinced her mother to let him come to his house for a photo shoot to "help" her career, he then got her into the hottub, drugged her with quaaludes and alcohol and raped her. So how does Hollywood treat this admitted rapist? Well he has made 6 movies since then, including The Pianist in which he won an Oscar for last year. Harrison Ford who starred in his movie Frantic accepted the award in his abscence as he is not allowed here, to step foot on American soil will cause him to serve his time on the rape charge. Currently he is filming a remake of Oliver Twist... You gotta fucking be kidding me, a child rapist directing a movie starring children. Can I vomit yet? Another reason I can't stand the French and have little regard for the opinion of people in Hollywood when it come to living in the REAL world.<br /><br />My final question on Bush and Iraq is this. Ask youself, if you were George Bush, you were selfish, and all you cared about was being re elected to the Presidency, wouldn't you have caved into pressure last year and handed this thing over to the UN? Anything to get re elected. It seems to me, we might actually have someone in him, that truly is more worried about the future of our Nation, our children, our grandchildren, and furthermore, the plight of others in the world. Unlike Kerry who in changing his position weekly on this subject...MY FAULT, FINE TUNING his position, truly only selfishly cares about his own political future.<br /><br />I am not done... LOL<br /><br />This is real short. All of this has been pretty much framed on foregn policy. What about domestic policy? I am glad you asked... oh, ou didn't, well do you think I am going to quit now?<br /><br />Real short, This is not an indictment of Clinton, I actually was fairly pleased economically with Clinton's last four years in office. It was amazing to watch, he signed nearly every bill the Republicans sent him. He had no worries on re election, so I guess it didn't matter to him. He didn't have to follow the party line, he even signed a bill that is helping to dismantle the Liberal sacred cow of welfare. I have a few conservative friends who call my opinion there blasphemy, but ya know what... Fuck Em, I call it like i see it. Because of the bursting of the tech bubble, Bush inherited an economy that was sliding into recession. There is a good argument that Clinton should have seen the overinflated tech sector inevitably popping, but for that matter, anyone with sense should have. Since then, we saw the Enron and WorldCom scandals that cost the nation in the TRILLIONS of dollars, 911 happened with countless more TRILLIONS needing to be spent on defense, security, victims families, and rebuilding. The near collapse because of 911 of the airline and tourist industries. People want to talk about jobs, but with Enron, WorldCom, the tech bubble, the airlines, and the tourist industry, the fact that we still have managed to create nearly two million jobs is a miracle in itself. Right now, home ownership is at 69% I know, I am a mortgage banker, and this is unprecidented. At no time in our country have we ever had so many of our population owning a piece of their lives. So much for the poor and middle class getting shit on huh! Anyway, I think with evrything that has happened, the fact that the economy is not only stable, but in its largest expansion in 20 years really speaks volumes about the domestic policy of our president. Don't give me no shot about the fucking rich! Class warfare gets us nowhere, it is used by people to get us bickering the same way racism is. Ask yourself a simple question. You all live here in the DC area... Well Fairfax, Loudon, Prince William, and Montgomery County are in the top five for wealth in the nation and you are also living in one of the most preominately Democratic areas of the nation. Both Dems and Republicans are both rich and poor. And also remember, NO SOCIETY HAS EVER BEEN TAXED INTO PROSPERITY! By giving the money back to the people, you create purchasing power, which creates jobs, which creates more workers to be taxed, which in the end creates more revenue for the government at a lower rate. Kennedy knew this, Reagan knew this, and Buch knows this.<br /><br />I keep hearing people bitch about the Patriot Act. Did you ever think of this? The people in charge have the job of protecting us. The government is set up with three branches for a system of checks and balances. It is the job of the Congress and the President in protecting us, to push the envelope of their abilities. The Patriot Act is overboard, but it is supposed to be. Congress and the President would have been derelict in their duties to pass a watered down version. It is now the job of the Supreme Court to pour over challenges to pieces of the Act and determine what is valid and what is not, and that is what is happening. They have already nixed some of the provisions. Freedom is a swinging pendulum, it goes from one extreme to another depending on the needs of the nation. Abraham Lincoln declared Martial Law. He suspended the Consititution during the Civil War. This enraged people and if you look back many voiced those fears as many voice them today. But when it was over, things were returned to normal. It is part of our history. My God people we are 228 years old and we are still here. We are the grand experiment. the idea that Freedom is given to us by our creator, it belongs to all of us, not to a select few monarchs or self appointed guardians. We have been through a Revolution that changed the entire planet, we have been through a Civil War that almost destroyed us, we have freed those that by our own hand we oppressed, and we have freed those who have been oppressed around the world. We have constantly fallen on our faces, and we have constantly learned from our mistakes.<br /><br />My father used to pull his hair out by my mistakes. I told you so is what he would always say. I finally looked at him a few years ago after he congratulated me for a job I got, and the huge raise that came with it and I asked him.... Do you see now that it is my life, and they are my mistakes and my triumphs to make" He finally understood why I am so hard headed and why I do things on my own. I had a realization later that night that that is what Liberty is. Liberty is the ability to self govern, to decide your own fate and your own freedom. We live in a majority rules country. We revolted because a small minority of monarchs made all of our decisions for us. We decided to govern ourselves as our own people.<br /><br /><br />Footnote... The guy mentioned above that shot Governor Wallace, Bremer. The movie Taxi Driver, starring Robert DeNiro was inspired by Bremer.. The irony? Taxi Driver would later be the movie that finally caused John Hinckley Jr to shoot President Reagan. Why did he shoot Reagan? To impress Jody Foster, whom he was in love with, whom was the actress that played the character that DeNiro's charachter was trying to impress. I wonder if Kevin Bacon's 6 Degrees of Seperation would fit in there? LOL<br /></span><br />

          Ok, so my girlfriend, like many girlfriends, are one of those types that put really romantic things in their online profiles that confess their love for their boyfriend. Currently, this is what my girlfriend's profile says (in pretty green text).<blockquote>Over time, I've been building my castle of love.  Just for 2, though you never knew you were my reason...</blockquote>I decided its time for me to start writing about my true feelings...so on my profile (in the same pretty green text) I put this:<blockquote>Over time, I've been building my dungeon of love.  Just for 1, though you never knew you were my reason...now I can lock you up underground, keeping you there forever, without anyone else knowing, my love.</blockquote>Man, I crack myself up fo sho.<br />
