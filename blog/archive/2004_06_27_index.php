          Well its July 3rd and today is my 20th Birthday.  I think this is the first birthday that i've actallu felt any different or older.  Im not a teenager anymore and now I wonder where the hell did the time go.  I also realize I have an extreamly busy next 10 years.  Graduating college, starting a carrer, finding a girl to marry(def twords the end of the 20's), supporting my self in the real world.  I also came to the conclusion I only have 2 more cool birthdays left.  21 of course and 25 so my insurance drops.  Then it seems im just wating on Death or the Senior citizens club which ever comes first.<br />

          I would like a social life now. I think I'm ready to branch beyond my reclusive habits and start not only talking to people, but hanging out with people in environments where it isn't forced such as it is at work or school. I have one group of friends. I want another because these other dudes bore me. Well, not really but people are damn busy. Now, since FSEVN brought up social lives... well, I'm not sure where I'm going with this. Just a rant.<br /><br />end<br /><br /><br />

          Well, well, well... it appears that I may have stumbled upon intelligent life here in Arlington! <a href="http://www.jess3.com">JESS3</a> is not only a webdesigner, but she lives HERE. I just sent her an email asking her to tell me wtf is going on around here. Maybe if I link her she will give me reason to step out of the house. My only worry is that I hope she doesn't think I'm an internet weirdo who puts peanut butter on his nose and runs around the house in whitey tighties and never emails me back.<br /><br />Well...I've never done those two things until now. Email me Jesse! As for the rest of yas, go to her site damnit. My social life is resting in the balance. *twitch*<br />

          The days here are starting to get shorter, and its not going to be long before I don't get to see the sun at all.  What a sad time of year that will be.   It makes me really appreciate it when I'm driving to and from work and the sun is out.  Never thought that would happen, and I used to laugh when my dad talked about it.  But, now I understand.  Sometimes, when I'm running late getting home, or I'm coming back from class, I'll go by the fields and see the fireflies twinkling in the wide open spaces.  Its enough to take your breath away.<br /><br /><br />

          I woke up today not feeling any more healed than I was yesterday. The illness lingers.<br /><br />So, it all started with that god damn letter I got this morning from my sister. That was nice. I haven't even had enough time today to think about it rationally and answer her. All I <em>could</em> think about, however, was how royally fucked up my family is.<br /><br />Then, my morning routine was ruined by my PDA not playing mp3s (not turning on at all). It's charging now so it's not broken or anything but that set me back 2 luxury points. Then, on the metro to work I stood by a man who was very well dressed but had horrible body odor. The girl who stood next to me, in nice business attire kept thinking it was me who stunk; probably because of my wild crazy curly hair. Screw her, I'll never see her again anyway.<br /><br />During work, I found myself ahead of the game at such a substantial distance that no one had me do <i>anything</i> all day. At the end of the day (1 hour early so I could run some errands) my boss and I compared DC to Marvel movies and comics. Turns out he's a DC guy-- more power to em but umm...everyone knows Marvel is better. I didn't know there is a <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/ff/">Fantastic Four movie coming out in 2005</a>.<br /><br />So I leave work early coming to the conclusion that you have to be really fucked up to read DC comics. I get on the metro, take it to Courthouse, get my ticket clipped for the ride, head up to vehicle registration where I meet this woman who was very nice. I simply opened up the envelope I was going to send them and gave her the items that were inside. She had me sign a couple things and I almost thought it was going to be that easy but then she told me to go to another window across the hall.<br /><br />I walk across the hall, nobody is in line. Nobody is in line, and yet it still takes me 5 minutes to be seen by someone. A middle-aged woman waves her hand for me to come in her direction. I hand her the things that the first woman gives me and she says to me:<blockquote>Woman: wait, you have a parking ticket?</blockquote>Which, technically, I did. But I explained the situation.<blockquote>Me: Yeah, see I had my parking permit on my dashboard but they gave me a ticket anyway. So, we wrote to the county and haven't heard anything back yet.<br />Woman: When did you send out your letter?<br />Me: almost two weeks ago.</blockquote>So she tells me to discuss this with the man standing at a window down the hall.<br /><br />I walk down the hall where the man is fidgeting in his chair (I don't blame him- sitting in front of an invisible wall would do the same to me).<blockquote>Man: Yesss SIR, whAt caN I do for you?<br />Me: Umm, I would like to discuss a parking situation with a deputy. Are you who I need to speak to?<br />Man: Who told you to see me?<br />Me: the woman down the hall.<br />Man: Well of course the woman down the hall told you to come over here, they always do.<br />Brain: Breathe in Joe...*sigh* DEEP BREATHS JOE!<br />Joe: SO *gritting teeth* what can we do about this?<br />Man: Well you can pay your ticket and then sign for registration.<br />Joe: But I didn't do anything <i>wrong</i>. I don't want to pay 65$ for something I didn't do.<br />Man: You had a parking pass disp--<br />Joe: Displayed on my dashboard. Wasn't expired, wasn't hidden, I wrote a letter to the county to get this figured out.<br />Man: Do you have a copy of this ticket?<br />Joe: No, I do not, sorry.<br />Man: Do you have a copy of this letter?<br />Joe: Why would I?<br />Man: See, we can't allow you to register without paying for the ticket.<br />Joe: but I'm taking care of the ticket.<br />Man: *clicks at computer* It's not that ticket thats keeping you from registerring. Its the one you got 2 days ago.<br />Joe: TWO DAYS AGO?!? I have another one?? So, I can't register because I have a ticket because I'm not registerred. Even though I have the proper identification and I'm not doing anything wrong I NEED to pay 65$ JUST SO I CAN REGISTER MY CAR TO KEEP THIS FROM REOCCURING?<br />Man: *laughs* Yes.</blockquote>So, long dialog short, I had to plead guilty by paying 65$ upfront for the ticket and THEN I didn't even get to register! <br /><br />I left that Courthouse a very unhappy camper.<br /><br />So I get home, make a bazillion phone calls to find Meaghan Foster, a REALLY good friend of mine from middle school and I finally found her and then my cell phone dies. So, I decide to take the movie rentals back. I followed my Uncle's directions there and they weren't that bad. Took me about...oh i dunno...10-15min to get there. But how long did it take me to get back?<center><h1>3 AND A HALF HOURS</h1></center>No one in the DC metro area knows a god damn thing about the DC metro area because they are always new residents. That just shows you how many people are migrating to this area from other parts of the country and the rest of the world. One of these days, DC is just going to pop like a mosquito that drank too much blood.<br /><br />I drove ALL THE WAY AROUND <strong>THE BELTWAY</strong> today coming back from Blockbusters. I was cursing like a sailor, punching my steering wheel; SO PISSED OFF because it was all so much bullshit. While I was in <u>Maryland</u> asking for directions, I looked at the food they had and I was so hungry but I had no money.<br /><br />But anyway, I'm so pissed off and tired that I don't even want to finish this post. Fuck it and every mother f'er who gave me shitty directions today. Burn in Hell, allaya's.<br />

          Got this in my mailbox from my blood sister this morning (yes, I have a sister). It is very much unedited but give her a break, she's only 16. Anyway, I need some help guys because she is pleading with anybody that can give her the right path. So if you could give this a read to understand the situation a little better, I'd be very thankful.<br /><br /><blockquote>OMG YOU KNOW THAT GUY WHO WAS LIVING IN OUR HOUSE FOR TWO WEEKS!!!HE FUCKIN STOLE FROM US- HE STOLE A BUNCH OF MEDICATION INCLUDING ALL MY ADDERALL! NO WONDER WHY HE KEPT COMING INTO THE KITCHEN TO BOTHER ME! YOU KNOW IF I DIDNT PURPOSELY TRIED TO IGNORE HIM, I WOULD OF SEEN ALL THE SHIT HE WAS DOING BEHIND MY BACK! you know when i said this guy gave me the creeps! WELL THATS FUCKIN WHY- I SHOULD OF LISTENED TO MY GUT FEELINGS! the whole time there was something about him, other than the fact that i saw him naked, there was something that he was hiding.  and i told my mom and dad not to have him come into the house while they were gone and i told them that there was something  about him that i didnt trust that gave me the "willies". AND NOW THAT IM RIGHT, MY MOM IS GETTING PISSY. BC WHENEVER I GET THE "WILLIES" THEY TELL ME TO IGNORE THEM AND WHEN IT TURNS OUT THAT IM RIGHT, THEY WONT ADMIT IT THAT I KNEW ALL ALONG!!!<br />man i hate my life where we always get taking advantage,MORE THE LESS, from an total ass wipe. and yet again he walks away a free man bc my parents are nothing but pussies to sew his sorry ass. i thought we were stupid before by letting a fucking idiot like jamie to live in our house for two weeks, but now i feel like we're retarded bc even a guy that has the brians of a slow monkey could steal from us! i thought those days were over....and i didnt kno why but i wanted to SI myself last night soooo badly, but someone to my knife and my pin. i usaully use the pin bc i fear to cut the vein. and i dont know why i needed it so badly....well  g2g and clean the house for my uncle's family. email me anyone, i feel like im going crazy here.<br /> <br />burro<br /> <br />joe im sorry this isnt important. but i still wish you were here to atleast yell at mom and dad for being such idiots that they are...</blockquote>So there you have it; just one of the many f'd up scenarios that I have lived through which is why I first made this site, which is why I'm so level-headed today.

          favorite song, eh?  Well that's pretty obvious for me, i think.  Paranoid Android is THE Stairway to Heaven of the 90's.  You can practically break that song down in to 3 different parts:  (1)Folky/Melodic guitar work that makes up the first part and sets forth the story of the song.  (2) The harsh middle/outro dominated by angry power chords and, dare I say, SQUISHY guitar solo, and (3) the break down that follows afterwards that sounds almost like a sort of eulogy ("rain down, from a great height").  And awesome lyrics.  I'm just waiting for my opportunity to call someone a "kicking, screaming, gucci little piggi".<br /><br />Other favorites include Life in a Glass House (gotta love the whole new orleans funeral feel of that one), Street Spirit, and How to Disappear Completely (listening to it is like listening a living instrument stuggling to hit a certain note; cool stuff).  <br /><br />I'd love to get my hands on more of their B-sides, but they're hard to come across, and i don't like buying singles, feeling they're not worth the money.  They need to just release an entire B-sides album, a la Build Something Out of Nothing.  <br /><br />Other great bands that i think are similar to Radiohead are Sigur Ros, Clinic, Beta Band and, in a way, Blur(those guys are very underrated).<br /><br />On another note i bought the new Cure album today; very cool stuff.  It's got a sort of early 90's grunge feel to it, combined with the classic gothy Cure sound.  And now that Lollapalooza's been canned (sadly), Curiosa Festival stands as the best festival this summer.  Oy, can't wait to see Interpol.<br /><br />Wow, look at how fast i broke from the topic w/ that last paragraph.  Meh.  <br />

          Taking my finally English class and there is nothing but faux-intellectuals.  Granted I’m not of the most reputable majors, so I have no room to talk.  However, if you are a Bio-medic engineer or a Chemical engineer you should know what the hell you are talking about.  So what, you graduated with an IB diploma in high school.  Now tell me why you cannot break down a simple essay and analyze it?  So what, you can throw around your Bio-medic terminology.  SO FREAKING WHAT?!  No one cares what you say or do if you cannot do the simple task of analyzing a 3 DOUBLE SPACED essay.  Drop the act and get over yourself.

          Yo. Has anybody seen any comercials for the "Hungry Man" frozen dinners? Well if you haven't, they boast to be a massive helping of food at a reasonable price... it's all true. I've indulged in my fair share of frozen dinners and they've been somewhat sub-par, to say the least. The Hungry Man dinners, however, have me astonished. It's like a pound of food and it's rather tasty, I must say; not only in terms of frozen dinners, but food in general. I would recommend that if you are a hungry man (or woman... sup ladies) you should try one of these dinners. It can go in the microwave OR the oven depending on your personal time constraints... um... BOOYA! peace.<br />

             Tuuk, and anyone else who's interested in SETI and that sort of thing, check out this link.  It's an equation, the Drake Equation, which examines the possibility of the existence of extraterrestrial life, and, more specifically, sentient ET life.  You can also find this equation in Carl Sagan's <em>Cosmos</em>, which you also might want to check out.  It basically examines various things such as the number of stars in our galaxy and the ability for life to arise in any given planet, and uses it to help us get a better idea of what might be living out there.  I don't want to call it guesswork or anything, but many of the variables have to be estimated, so it can't be 100% accurate.  Anyway, check it out for yourself.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.html">The Drake Equation</a><br />

          I was thinking about what might be a good topic to post next on E3r, and decided that i'd write about the absolute worst marijuana experience i've ever had.  I realize that marijuana is a very controversial subject and i thought i'd attempt to write something that appeals to both sides of the debate.  So here goes:<br /><br />One boring night during my very first semester at college me and two friends of mine decided to throw in on a huge amount of weed with about 10 other strangers.  I was quite the consistent smoker in those days and jumped at the opportunity to partake in one, huge smokefest.  It took place at a random guy's apartment.  We get there and everyone proceeds to take their seat in a huge partial circle, except for a group of 3 or 4 guys near the kitchen playing what looks like an intense game of poker.  My seat is in the middle of the couch, between the two friends i came with.  And so it begins, and goes on, and never seems to stop.<br /><br />It should be known that i'm a quiet guy by nature.  Not so much when people get to know me, but around strangers or even casual friends i can be very quiet and to myself.  Large doses of weed only make me more quiet than usual.<br /><br />Nobody seems to be doing much socializing during the whole stay i'm here.  The guys in the poker game are so into it that they only acknowledge anyone else when they're handed a bowl.<br /><br />It wasn't a very rich social environment.<br /><br />When i'm faced with moments of silence, i try to think of something to say to liven things up.  When weed's involved, and i'm around people i don't know well, this usually results in nervousness and reluctance.  <br /><br />I've no idea just how long we smoked.  It seemed to go on forever.  Everytime i passed the bowl to the left another one would come from the right.  And so on.<br /><br />After a while, needless to say, i'm incredibly f*cked up.  Things are still relatively quiet, and i'm feeling very uncomfortable.  South Park is on the tv, but i'm so preoccuppied with trying to remain cool that i'm not paying attention to it.  I'm missing a pretty funny episode as i tell myself, very sternly, 'don't say you want to go home, you will look like a complete buzzkill'.  And there was a hot girl at the other end of the couch.  I didnt want to look like a lightweight.  <br /><br />Things get so bad in my mind that i start swallowing uncontrollably, practically every other second.  It seems that i'm suffering from periodic shake outbursts as well, like a kind of chill you get when a cold gust of wind blows by.  "I think i want to go home", i hear myself say, before scolding myself for breaking my promise from earlier in the night.  <br /><br />I could have been suffering from delusions caused by the amount of pot in me, but it seemed like the room had turned against me; that i was some kind of unwelcome kid who just happened to find his way in.  I'm not certain if the guys at the poker table joked about cutting my hair into a mullet or if that was all in my head.  Same thing with the hot girl saying something about me that had me on edge.  I mean it when i wasn't certain, my mind just seemed to keep telling me what i didnt want to hear, i didn't know whether or not to trust it.  <br /><br />Shortly after that, we finally left.  I've no idea how bad i actually was from the outside, but on the inside, it felt like i was having an anxiety attack.  I'm still not sure if what i felt that night was an anxiety attack or not.  Man, was i paranoid as hell though (no pun intended).  <br /><br />Not long after that night i decided to quit smoking for good, following a similar incident that occured a few weeks later, though not quite as bad.  I decided pot just didnt agree with me.  I went almost a year with (barely) any before i started again, but only casually.  These days, when i do smoke, i do it very moderately, and never in large groups or at parties.  I've learned my limits.<br /><br />I've nothing against people that smoke frequently, though i know many people look down on it.  I for one think that it should be legalized, though i don't see that happening any time soon, and that in itself is another topic.  But, let me point out that it does have its benifits.  I truly believe that weed makes people more open minded, expands their interests in music, and makes a person more creative as it helps you to consider ideas in an entirely new light.  <br /><br />I also think it can turn people in to lazy, low income couch potatoes.<br /><br />Yeah, i know.  This was fairly long, and probably not interesting to a lot of people.  However, i posted this because i think this is something people should consider, experienced hippies and wound up conservatives alike.  To help make people more....<br /><br />What was i saying?  Bah!  I need joint.<br /><br />

          <i>In which I present a previous view of our universe which seems to be logical, consistent, and rather pessimistic. It is also wrong.</i><br /><br />There is no such thing as free will. The universe has a set path, from beginning, to (potential?) end.<br /><br />Our universe is governed by physical laws, laws such as gravity, newtonian physics, even relativity. For every physical action, there is one, and only one, corresponding reation. If I throw a ball upwards into the air, it will invariably fall. If two ping pong balls strike each other with the same speed and direction twice in a row, then both times they will bounce in exactly the same way.<br /><br />While obviously true for ping pong balls, this governance of the universe by physical laws applies at all levels, from planetary motion to the interaction of individual atoms. A certain chemical reaction, done twice, will twice give the same results. If one could accurately recreate -any- chemical reaction, down to the subatomic level of detail, it would have identical results to its original.<br /><br />Human beings are a collection of atoms involved in a complex chemical reation, and both atoms and their interactions are quite thoroughly governed by rules. Because the bare components of ourselves are governed by rules, then we ourselves are inherently the product of the application of rules. Because we are governed by rules, our current state can only have one possible future state: the state achieved by applying those rules to our bodies.<br /><br />Granted, human beings are -incredibly- complex chemical reactions. Simply knowing the physical laws involved in our constant chemical reaction does not easily give us the ability to predict our set-in-stone future, because there is simply not enough computing power in the entire world, even in the entire solar system, to model so complex a reaction as a human being for any reasonable amount of time. Massive supercomputers have been utilized to demonstrate the exact happenings of a nuclear reaction, but even this nuclear reaction is, compared to a human, ridiculously simple.<br /><br />It would seem, then, that humans are governed by physical laws, even if we are too complex for us to be able to model (and thus predict) our own future. This does not really matter, though. By simply being governed by physical laws, it is proven that even though we could never actually complete the computations required, our future states are still wholly dependant on our past states. Free will, then, is an illusion.<br /><br />Does a computer have free will? Obviously not; a computer is governed in its entirety by the application of physical laws. So much are these laws concrete and unchanging that we have been able to advance our computers beyond what was once ever imagined, because by knowing the laws which govern our computers, we can design more powerful computers to take advantage of these laws. The CPU, once simply a set of circuitry, is now so fast and sensitive that it must be designed with quantum physics. Processor speed limitations are known and explored so well that a modern computer's CPU is limited by the speed of light itself, ie the time it takes for an electric current to move from one side to another of a 2cm slab of silicon crystal. Computers are indeed impressive, but they are just as equally governed by known physical laws. If you knew the entire state of a computer at one point in time, you would inherently know the state of the computer at any point in the future, simply by applying these physical laws.<br /><br />Humans, much as we may dislike it, are simply super-evolved computers. We are governed by physical laws. If we could somehow know every state of every subatomic particle in ourselves, we could therefore predict with certainity ANY future state. Because we can predict any future state, free will must be an illusion! For if we are governed solely by physical laws, how then can we have free will? Free will, it would seem, can only exist if we could somehow defy our physical laws, which we simply cannot do.<br /><br />The educated student, however, will next point to quantum chance, and say "Quantum chance says that we cannot predict what will happen next. Surely this means that in a computer so dependant on quantum chance as the human brain, our futures are thusly unpredictable?" Close, but no cigar.<br /><br />Quantum chance is a byproduct of heisenberg uncertainty, which shows that we simply cannot measure any (sub) atomic event or waveform with enough accuracy to predict its future. This is because, while an electron may have position and velocity, any attempt to measure one of these attributes will, and must, change the other, in a way which we cannot predict. Free will? Almost.<br /><br />Simply because we cannot -measure- both an electron's position and velocity does not mean that it does not have such a position or velocity. Both of these quantities exist for every electron. Suppose we have electron A and B. If we want to measure both A's position and velocity, we would then do so by causing it to interact with electron B, of known position and velocity. By measuring A with a known particle B, we could accurately predict the quantity which would be disturbed by our very measurement of the other. But we cannot do this, because it is impossible for us to know both position and velocity of electron B in the first place.<br /><br />Evidently, we cannot predict quantum events with certainity, because we cannot know all of the necessary information. Thus, the term "quantum chance" is used to denote this inherent uncertainty in our measurement. But simply because we cannot know both position and velocity of an electron does not mean that the electron does not -have- position and velocity. It obviously has both, because both are characteristics of electrons. And because electrons are governed by rules, so are their interactions. While we will never know enough information about an electron to predict the result of an interaction with certainity, we -can- say with certainity that the reaction was predetermined. This is because though we may not know all the imformation necessary to make a prediction, that information still exists, and is still the sole deciding factor in the outcome of a reaction.<br /><br />At even the smallest levels, our reality is governed by rules. Because every component of a human being is governed by rules, so then must be the human itself.<br /><br />We are governed by rules. All chemical interactions in what we call humans are predetermined, no matter whether or not we have the ability to discover all of the parameters involved. Humans are simply giant, complex computers. Like computers, our lives are fixed. Free will does not exist.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br /><i>Or does it? It is the purpose of this series of essays to demonstrate, in a logical, consistent, and provable manner, that free will does in fact exist. Stay tuned for chapter two.</i><br /><br />

          Had this funny dream last night. I'm afraid to talk about it because some people might get the wrong idea but I'll leave comments open.<br /><br />I'm driving on my way to some place when I suddenly take a right down a road that looks very familiar. I stop my car and knock on a door that looks very familiar. The door opens and it's the mother of a girl I dated a while back. <blockquote>Mom: Oh, hello Joe. What a surprise it is to see you here.<br />Me: yeah, I feel the same way. I'm not entirely sure why I'm here too.<br />Mom: are you looking for [GIRL NAME]?<br />Me: Yes, I guess I <em>am</em> looking for her.<br />Mom: Well, lemme go get her.<br />Me: Thanks.</blockquote>She leads me in the door and lets me sit on a chair while I wait. I start getting worried because I can't remember why I'm in this place and why I'm about to speak to one of my ex's. That's when I look down to see that there is an envelope in my hand with her name written on it in my handwriting. Suddenly, I realize why I came here and everything makes sense-- allowing my anxiety fade quickly. [GIRL NAME] walks into the room with her head tilted slightly, questioning with body language why I have come to her house after almost three years. I rise to my feet, smiling.<blockquote>Ex: Hi Joe...<br />Me: Hi, umm, did I come at a bad time?<br />Ex: No, I just never would have expected to see you in my house again.<br />Me: Well, I feel that I have a very good reason to be here. I've been thinking about this for a while and I decided that it couldn't sit in my mind any longer. So here.</blockquote>I take a step closer to her, who now looks totally confused and nervous. I put out my hand and give her the envelope with her name on it.<blockquote>Ex: what is this?<br />Me: Read it when I leave.</blockquote>Still in the dream I see myself from a third person point of view walk out of the door and close it behind me. I get into my car, back out of her driveway, and ride off into the distance. Then I see her right where I left her, in her living room. She takes the letter into her father's office, rips it into quarters and tosses it into the garbage. She begins IMing her friends with the computer that sits right in front of it, telling them what happened. One of her friends ask: "What was in the letter??"<br /><br />She looks down at the trash bin where the torn letter rests on top. She notices that the pages are exposed out of the envelope a bit, but there is no visible handwriting anywhere. She bends over and picks out three piece of the four and unfolds the letter inside. Nothing.<br /><br />Confused, she takes the last piece out of the trash can and unfolds it. In the top, left-hand corner of the letter there are four words, followed by a period. She reads it once, puts it down on the desk, laughs to herself, picks it up again to recheck, throws it in the garbage, then pulls her keyboard towards her to respond to her inquiring friend. She types to her friend, "All it said was: <strong>'Vote democratic this election.'</strong> with a smiley face at the end."<br />
