          Over the past week I have been seeing person after person attempting to be 1337.  Usage extends to the normal jargon of 1337 *which is understandable* to everyday conversation *which is not*.  First thing it reminded me of was when punk was the new trend. <br /><br />  All i have to say about that shit is: get your own identity you trendy-abercrombie-and-fitch-wearing-like-it-if-MTV-says-to-love-it LOSERS.  Stop invading territory that you don't belong in just because it is your flavour of the month.  Prats.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for these heathens and let them know what is up.<br />

          So I was working at Foster's Grille today, and a group of people come in to eat, and they're pretty metal'ed out.  Now i know that Ozzfest is tomorrow, and it's only a few miles away, and these guys look like they aren't amateurs... plus they have European accents.<br /><br />So I say, "Hey there, are you guys playing Ozzfest tomorrow?"<br /><br />"Yes we are," says the bassist (I knew he had to be the bassist, and he was... it's a bassist's "sixth sense" that I have) "we're playing early tomorrow, at 10ish."<br /><br />I say, "Awesome, what band are you guys, anyway?"<br /><br />"Lacuna Coil," says the guitarist of Lacuna Coil.<br /><br />Now this was a band that I had heard a lot about from various people, but I had never actually listened to them before.  I knew they were pretty well known, but they're kind of a Gothy band, so I never really listened to them... just heard one of my bass students play their stuff.  Anyway, there were 6 of them, and two of them, a guy and a girl, did not look like the others, so I figured they were a roadie and a groupie.<br /><br />So after work, I get home, and look them up, listen to some of their music and what-not.  Turns out, they're Italian, and they're a lot like Evanescence but better, because they're not so formulaic, I guess.  But here's what really made me kick myself: that girl I wrote off as a groupie, because she was kind of dressed-down and incognito, was their LEAD SINGER, INCREDIBLY HOT, ITALIAN, and was SITTING BY HERSELF on the curb, waiting to be picked up by the tour bus as I was driving away.  I mean, holy shit, I know that she's a little bit out of my league, but I should've hit on her at least a LITTLE bit... I mean, goddam!  Look at her!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lacunacoil.it/etc/html/photos/photosession/um05.jpg">Yowza!</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.lacunacoil.it/etc/html/photos/photosession/lc01.jpg">So hot, so Italian</a><br /><br />And now I'm going to go cry.<br />

They have implemented a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor for their posting engine and it may throw people off. Kobold's last post was somehow affected by this, and unfortunately, it had to be deleted. Sorry Kobold, I tried to save it but there was simply nothing left.</span></div><br />We advise everybody to take a look at the editor before you post.  If you know anything about M$ Word or anything of the like you should be okay. They have font face &amp; size selection, bold, italic, font color, hyperlinking, then text-justification followed by lists, blockquoting, spellchecking, file/picture uploading, and a remove-formatting button (which deletes all the html you may or may not have put into the individual post).<br /><br />Furthermore, E3R underwent some touching up yesterday too.  Comments are now known as "Blurbs" and you can comment to a post if you see # cmnts by the post byline. There are also smaller, less interesting things that we have changed around the site.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">We are also looking for contributors for a news splash and some new headers. </span> Send all contributions to <a href="mailto:devlogik@gmail.com">Devlogik@gmail.com.</a><br /><br />Comments are open, as we want some feedback on these new changes.<br />

          Listening to Yann Tiersen<br /><br /><br />                                        +           Talented man.  <br /><br />Friday.  I have nothing to do.  Actually, I should write my English paper.  But, who wants to write a paper that they do not have any passion to write it?  I just chose the topic because I had to.  I have no emotional attachment to this paper, I don’t care if someone reads my paper and is like: “You know, she has something there.  Maybe we should make a change.”  My plans for today was to talk to some of the International kids that are here for the summer and ask them some investigative questions on what issues in the news that they are impacted.  My luck:  they all went to work REALLY early and most of them will not be back until 10 or 11 PM.  BUMMER.  <br /><br />GUYS:  This whole recluse life that you want to pursue…. why?  Why run away? The reasons for running are silly.  Yes, FSEVN is right on the mysterious thing.  Girls totally like a guy that intrigues them, one that makes them think and really work to see what makes them tick---FSEVN--.  However, if you are just running away from ONE girl who is just an emotional fuckwittage, then that is  problem: poor skills in seeing what the girl really is about.  You just saw the sparkles and glitter of a beautiful shell.  That shell, boys, she puts out because her inner beauty fails to meet normal decency.   A wolf in sheep’s clothing, if you will.  <br /><br />A SOLUTION:  write them off.  That girl means nothing to you.  If you feel the urge to be a hermit then do it because you want to better yourself.  Focus more on what makes you happy and prosperous.  Find some outlet to pour your heart into other than stressing about that vindictive girl.  In the end, if you place your time, effort, energy, and heart into what ever makes you that “renaissances man” and “mysterious man”, then you're set.  <br /><br />Now go.  Find yourselves.  <br /><br /><br />Milo <br /><br /><br />

          I'm going out on a nerdy limb here, but I think that this "disappearing from the world" business holds a lot of parallels with the Lord of the Rings.  See, sometimes, if you feel troubled or threatened, you just need to put on the old One Ring and escape from the orcs of the world for a while.  But while this can keep you out of trouble for a little while, you can't retreat forever; you can't just run away from everything all your life, and there will inevitably be a time when you have to confront something... else you just kind of trap yourself with what you haven't been able to achieve or accomplish, through your own conscience and self-expectations; the vigilant Eye of Sauron if you will.  This Eye of Sauron will, of course, haunt you, madden you, until you become a Gollumish deformity of your former self, and your Precious escape will be the only thing left for you.  Yeah, Lord of the Rings is sweet.  <br /><br />So put on that Ring of Invisibility, but use it sparingly, lest you become a Gollum, or Sauron finds you, or the Witch-king of Angmar stabs you with his virulent, black blade.  Also, make sureth you holdest on to thine mithril mail, lest thou findest thineself on the sharp end of a cave troll shish-kabob'ith.  For sooth!<br /><br />Shut up, it's been a long day.<br />

          ..because chances are they aren't willing to give the same to you. it's funny, i was "with" the person that told me that and decided to brush it off and give her 100% anyway. twice now in the past 6 months it's come back to really kick me in the ass. I've come to the conclusion that _GIRLS_ must LIKE to be treated like tools, else they'll brush you off and walk all over you.<br /><br />and just for good measure: I'm fucking sick and tired of girls complaining that guys are 'heroes' or whatever you'd think we consider them when they shack up w/ lots of girls while the opposite holds true for girls. well, when you girls stop treating the guys that actually care like small change we might stop fucking you then forgetting you.<br /><br />but the chances of that happening? i agree. carry on<br /><br />--jaded, harmless<br />

          Well now I'm cold and bitter. Fuck the world. Sour grapes, I suppose.<br /><br />I evidently can't have what I want. Human companionship, it seems, is just not possible for statistical outliers like me. I have friends, and for that I am thankful, but I've finally been forced to concede that friends is all I will ever have.<br /><br />What do I want? Sympathy, maybe. Maybe not. If I can't have all of what I want, I don't want any of it. I don't want to be reminded that I'll always fall a little too short.<br /><br />I have a goal now. I'm going to save up my money and get self-sufficient. I'm going to go away as soon as I can, and never look back. I'm throwing all of my life away, because I'm sick of being who I am. I'm going to be alone anyways, so I may as well be alone voluntarily.<br /><br />Don't tell me you care, because I know you don't. Leave me alone to simmer in my misery. Maybe I'll come back once I no longer have any hope.<br />

          I read this on /. maybe a week ago, but I've since been hung up on it, as I have a tendency to get stuck on thoughts:<br /><br /><blockquote>From an outsider's point of view, everything man-made is as <i>natural</i> as anything else made by other organisms on this planet.</blockquote><br /><br />Granted, it would have to be an extremely outsider point of view, but it applies. All other organisms on this planet try to survive and maintain a dominance in their niche without regard for the well-being of others. Are they entitled to something we are not because our species has come out on top? Why can we not (continue to) expend the resources available to us and move on to another habitat? Who is to define what OUR niche is? Perhaps our niche is to propagate through our solar system and then through space to spread the seeds of Earth life? Maybe instead of being on top of the food chain we are at the bottom of something of such a much larger scope that we are unaware of it?<br /><br />Just a few of the questions prompted by this intriguing statement. Comments welcome<br />

          Check it:<blockquote>As reported in the July 5, 2004 edition of the St. Petersburg Times, Laura Lee's new book, The 100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them, finds that some accidents do occur in libraries.<br /><br />In the United Kingdom more people are hurt by books (2,707 a year) than by training weights (1,884), trampolines (1,902) or cricket balls and bats (1,174). In addition, 10,683 Americans were injured by what the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System categorizes as "books, magazines, albums or scrapbooks" in an average year, and another 1,490 are injured by magazine racks or bookends.<br /><br />Other book hazards reportedly documented in the book include moving and carrying injuries from boxes or backpacks overloaded with books, repetitive stress injuries from shelving books, and allergic reactions to dust and mold found on older books.</blockquote>careful FSEVEN for your love for your place of peace might be the key to your demise!!!!!!!<br /> <strong>DEATH BY PAPER CUT!!</strong><br />..joking.. just something i found on the internet.<br />

"It's only for access, for security and so that I can also be located at any moment anywhere I am." <br /><br />The $26 million data bank was created to link information on criminals and records of outstanding arrest warrants among the attorney generals branch offices in all 31 states and the federal district. <br /><br />The chip can't be removed, but will be deactivated after Macedo's term as attorney general expires, he said. <br /><br />About 160 Mexican officials will carry the microchip, according to the Mexico City daily El Universal. <br /><br />When asked if the implant hurt, Macedo replied, "a little."</blockquote>How do you feel on this subject?

          Beelo and VCUfest, I must agree that the lake trip was incredible.  It was the kind of weekend that makes going back to the old routine seem like much more of a Herculean labor than it ought to; the kind of weekend that makes me want to sleep in a tent and live out the month of August on fish, berries, and Kerouac.  I ended up buying a decent fishing rod and tackle, and I still have until next year before my fishing license expires, so I'm going to try to use it a lot between now and then.  And blackberries should be ripe in late summer, so this plan of mine could almost work.  I just reread the essay "Once More to the Lake," so I really want to go back up to Maine sometime this summer... I just wish it wasn't so far away.  Well, that's enough talk for now.  I'm sleeping outside tonight.<br />

          I know there have been an annoying amount of posts from me today but I'm in a posting mood and OH WAIT I OWN THE PLACE so anyway I don't know if any of you remember but I used Blogger's profiling service to try to find somebody around the Arlington area to chill with while I spend the summer here.  So I found <a href="http://www.jess3.com">Jesse</a>, who is not only in the area but is also a professional webdesigner. I decided to email <a href="http://www.jess3.com">Jesse</a> and ask if there was any interest in telling a newb to the area any cool things to check out.<br /><br />We passed emails back and forth for a week or so but yesterday was eye opening for me. Here is a conversation I had today with one of E3R's posters about the outcome.<blockquote><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3586520">Ninjaboie</a>: anyways you ever hear back from that web designer girl you emailed?<br />me: lol yes<br />me: morgan was mad at me because she thought that the girl was hot<br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3586520">Ninjaboie</a>: ..oh..jelousy thing?<br />me: and I was thinkin 'whatever' I just want to hang with somebody<br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3586520">Ninjaboie</a>: right.<br />me: so <a href="http://www.jess3.com">Jesse</a> and I have been sending emails back and forth for a while now and yesterday she IMs me<br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3586520">Ninjaboie</a>: makes sense I mean you know like nobody out there man<br />me: offers to take me to a bar I decline because I'm not 21.<br />me: and I say 'nevertheless, you have some serious skill!'<br />me: she says 'thank you, sir'<br />me: and I say...<br />me: "no problem, ma'am."

          My first blog in a while.  Well, i did have one a little over a week ago, several paragraphs long that magically dissappeared.  Blah!  That's what i say.<br /><br />Anyway, off to Italy tomorrow for a 2 week long excursion w/ fam.  Looking forward to finding ways to sneak off and legally drink.  I'm hoping the language barrier won't be too much of a problem.  Just need to learn the italian word for 'drink' and i think i'm set.  Thought i'd do something i've never tried before, and that's logging my travels across Italy.  Man, i went to England and France 2 summers back; now i can hardly remember where i went while i was there.  Maybe a log will help keep the memories alive and burning.<br /><br />In my last post that never came to be i wrote something about how Marvel is superior to DC in practically everyway.  I see this conversation still lingers, so i figured i'd add my 2 cents.  Marvels characters are just easier to relate to than DC's.  Marvel heros are struggling students working a superhero night job; DC heros are superpowered aliens with the concept of Justice infused into their brains.  Now who can i identify with more?  A struggling student, or an allmighty self righteous alien?     DC, on the other had, has Vertigo; which is a seperate line of comics set apart from the DC universe and geared specifically towards adults.  They've published some of the best adult comics ever, such as Sandman, Preacher, Hellblazer, and 100 Bullets.  It's great stuff; def worth checking out to all my fellow geeks.<br /><br />That's all i really feel like saying right now.  Ah, Tuuk, i'd love to get ahold of those Radiohead B-sides you mentioned a while back.  My email's BigD4587@aol.com, assuming the offer still stands.  <br /><br />Well then....WHAMMY!<br />

          in agreement with beelo, i'd have to agree that the trip to the lake was something of an escape from all the bullshit we put up with. i recommend that all try a relaxing weekend at a quasi-secluded spot where you don't have to do what you do all the time and can just laze around and think about lazing around. good times.<br />

          I almost dragged my ass out of the house today but after dinner and having a Devlogik Symbiot meeting I'm just too tired. Perhaps Thursday, after I see Fahrenheit 911. In other news, my computer screen at work makes a loud screaming sound that only I can hear. I also managed to piss off the entire tech team at NCPC. I offered to implement a system that would have kept them from spending a whopping 500,000$ but it was already. Another one bites the dust to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">MacroHard</a> and everybody at NCPC is now disappointed at the tech team because they said no to my proposal (which I wasn't really planning on them to take seriously in the first place) and now Tech is "shaking their heads" at me and my stinky, stupid proposal. But anyway, that's just a peak at the politics that I have witnessed here at the quarters of Crime Prevention. If McGruff knew about this I swear...he'd be very unhappy.<br /><br />Who am I kidding? McGruff is actually a robot that is powered by the souls of little children. oops, the secrets out! (joking, he doesn't eat children-- just naws on them for a little bit and spits em out.)<br />

          well here i am, fucked up, listening to the new linkin park cd. very cool, but i'm worried, i'm worried that lexa is ignoring me, because i haven't been able to get in touch with her for several days. i'm afraid that she's decided she doesn't actually like me, but i don't really have any evidence for that conclusion. for a few days, i felt like things were finally going -right- in my life. now i have to wonder if that was just an illussion. at the very least i stiull have my work, which i am doing well. assistant manager, with talk of me ending up as a store manager when i'm ready for it. lots of responsibility, but i like that. i think i'm up for it.<br /><br />my sister has a friend over for a few weeks. her name is Eva, and she's from germany. it's kinda weird, it's like my family sorta gained another member. which reminds me, hehe. fuck it. my sister makes more money than me per hour, and she's had a job for about a week. that's a pretty sweet job.<br /><br />so fucked up. so fucked up.<br /><br />chill wit' ya laters all. peace --<br />

          It's nice to hear that you have a place to escape, beelo. I used to spend a lot of time at the library because, unlike you, my escapes are to places that are completely metropolitan (and the library @ RVA is the newest looking thing for the past 200 years of architecture there). One of these days I'll find that place...a place that I will just see. There was one place...a place that was surrounded by dump trucks and has gone missing from the map- like it never even existed. Everyone has a place like that... a place that looks good to only you... and thats probably people look at you funny when they find out where you are.<br />

          So I spent this weekend with some of my best friends, camping and fishing for two and a half epiphany-filled days on the grassy shores of Lake Anna. It was my first fishing trip ever, and I've discovered that I love the anti-sport--the discipline, devotion, and patience involved, and the inevitable mastery that can only come from these things over a lifetime of fishing. I would have never guessed that such wholesome fulfillment was but a rod, tackle, and lake away at all times. See, when I'm fishing, it's ok that people break plans with me and don't return my calls. It's ok that I've got a 6 hour drive back to the daily grind. It's ok that my car's a piece and I haven't the time nor drive to get it fixed or get a better one. It's ok that girls toy with me--because I'll toy right back. It doesn't even matter if I don't catch a thing...The point is I'm out fishing, and not worrying about these things. And this weekend was made even better by the fact that I was with a bunch of friends that I know I can absolutely trust and do place absolute trust. It was like shared solitude, away from all the madness of the real world.<br /><br />Good weekend fellas...good weekend...<br />

          I know how you both feel.  I'm stuck all around, thoroughly burned out and becoming massively lonely.  It could just be that I'm sick, but I'm also sick of how I'm living.  The only thing I have to look forward to right now is the hope that a girl at work might have an interest in me.  As much as it would seem she does, it seems equally likely that I'm just farting against the wind.  God, I haven't said that since I was 13.  I keep wanting to apologize to her, or be angry with her.  Really I'm just angry with myself, and sorry in general that this is where I am.  I can't think of taking on fall classes already feeling this empty, but at least I'll get the feeling that I'm working toward something.<br /><br />I have a task now, setting up a server for work.  It's slow going, one error after another to work out.  At the end, I feel like I'm doing nothing.  I've got to get this done and implemented inside 9 days, and all I can think of doing is curling up on a couch with Shannon.  Shannon is the girl at work, and the mirror in which all my faults are reflected.<br />

          Sometimes I feel like theres a hole inside of me, an emptiness that at times seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your ear, you could probably hear the ocean. The moon tonight, theres a circle around it. Sign of trouble not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still sometimes, when the wind is warm or the crickets sing... I dream of a love that even time will lie down and be still for. I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I don't know. Maybe I had my happiness. I don't want to believe it but, there is no man. Only that moon.<br />

          You know how Superman gets all weak when he's near Kryptonite? Or how Submariner gets when he hasn't been in water in a while? Or how Captain Planet gets when he's dumped in a keg of sludge? That's kinda how I feel right now. My creativity, which is the main source of motivation for my job is being faultered by stress. It's slowing me down, I can't think straight, I feel like I'm thinking in constipated globs instead of an easy flow.  That...just grossed myself out.<br />
