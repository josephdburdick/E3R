          ... brought forward some misunderstanding. I didn't mean to discredit all of these newer bands. I don't like any of the musicians and bands nearly as much as these new groups coming out; however, my point was in order to be great you need to be timeless. If after 10 years or 20 years you fade away into the extremely rare radio request on the oldies station then you were good, but you weren't great. <br /><br />Music speaks to everyone. Every song out there means something to someone, but my interpretation of "greatest musicians ever" automatically makes me think of your beetles or bob marley and the wailers or even beetoven. I still think there has to be a certain noticable impact generated to seperate a musician from good and great. <br />

          Like up until today, I thoroughly enjoyed having the beloved <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/21/">badger song</a> stuck in my head until I went to the theater. While waiting in line for tickets, lo and behold, this group of shaggy-gotta-beat-this-game-and-its-sequel-before-i-shower-and/or-sleep types were in a circle, pumping fists intensely to their own ominous chant of badger badger badger badger badger... then with the utmost jubilance destroyed the song forever yelling MUSHROOM, MUSHROOM!!! It drew a few stares, to include my death stare, and that was the end of that. Call me shallow, but I want nothing to do with those guys. They should shower more. And stop ruining songs for me.<br /><br />-- Better than those guys.<br /><br />P.S. I'd also like to add that yes, that would be considered influential, good, classic, timeless music.<br />

          <b>In which Cless embarks on a foolish journey that nearly kills him</b><br /><br />Okay, so here's my story of stupidity for you all to laugh at. A few days ago I decided to go to a local demonstration of Apple's new pro lineup of video softwareâ€”Final Cut Pro HD, Motion, DVD Studio Pro 3, and Shake 3.5. I was really excited about this, since I'd be going with my friend Anthony from JMU, a fellow SMAD major and DV junkie. He was supposed to come pick me up from work at 9AM, drive me to the Metro, we'd go to Arlington and check this place out, then go hang with a friend and have some lunch, then head back.<br /><br />Flash forward to Thursday morning. I'm sitting in my office at 9:00AM, having been there for a half hour, and Anthony hasn't called. I'm a little nervous, but wait until about 9:15. Still no call, so I go outside to wait. It's 9:22 or so now, and I'm afraid he isn't coming. So, I decide to hoof it from my office to the Vienna Metro station, because I REALLY want to go. Problem: I'm wearing a sweater and pants, because it's cold in my office (and always cold in movie theaters, which is where the demo was being held).<br /><br />I'm about a third of the way there and I'm already sweating nicely; it's very muggy and hot out. I'm not making good time, and suddenly the Metro station seems very far away. But I push through it. I get to the intersection of Lee Highway and Nutley, now soaked in sweat (and seemingly unable to sweat anymore). But the goal's just around the bend. It's pushing 10, so I'll be late already, but at least I'll get there.<br /><br />Then I get lost. I know, it seems ridiculous, but I took a wrong turn, got into a housing development and couldn't figure out where to go from there. By this point I'm definitely not actively sweating anymore, and my legs are quite tired. I decide to turn around and go to the nearest office building to try and get some directions. I get there, and ask a guy how to get there. He gives me some patently unhelpful directions and then leaves. I try to find the Metro again. 20 minutes later, I'm back at the same building, feeling faint, disoriented, and dizzy. My feet REALLY hurt at this point. I ask a lady outside for some help. She tells me to sit down and gives my dumb ass a bottle of water. This woman is, obviously, a saint.<br /><br />A commuter bus shows up and takes me to the Metro station, which is what I should've done in the first place. It's now 10:30. I've missed a half hour of the event, and will miss another 20 or so in transit. By the time I get there, it's 10 of 11. I'm already shaking my head in mild disgust, questioning my own sanity.<br /><br />Turns out they started a half hour late, so I'd only missed 20 minutes of introduction and Final Cut Pro (which I'm most familiar with). Found Anthony during an intermission. They skipped the Shake demo at the end due to lack of time, which caused me to kill everyone in the room and steal me a G5. Just kidding. But it did bother me a lot, since that's what I was most interested in. Looks like it's time to buy the training book w/ the 30-day-trial.<br /><br />And after all that, when Anthony and I compared timings, it seems I left my office JUST before he called, and left the parking lot JUST before he arrived. All this headache could've been avoided if I'd been that much more patient.<br /><br />So there you go; that's how I almost killed myself in the summer heat. Moral: if you're a geek, never go outside unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY and you're equipped for the environment. Otherwise, you'll die, or at least suffer exhaustion and a severe injury to your pride.<br />

          Cless, feel free to post now without fear of being a "front-page whore."<br /><br />So I think NothinGold here brings up an interesting topic about bands and musicians.  What do you base the qulaity of music on?  Its ability to "take the world by storm"?  Should the quality of someone's music be heavily based on its influence on future musicians?<br /><br />First, let's look at what takes the world by storm.  On the one hand, you've got the Beatles and Nirvana; on the other hand, Britney Spears and New Kids On the Block.  Sure, there was Beatlemania, but who didn't love MC Hammer?  Granted, the Hammer might not have been quite as huge as the Beatles, but I do believe he would qualify as "taking the world (or at least the US) by storm."  The point I'm trying to make with this is that lots of things become crazy popular, but most of them are what most people would consider to be, at least in retrospect, dumb things (see also: Tamagotchi, Macarena).<br /><br />Also, do all bands need to influence everyone to be good?  I would disagree there.  There are plenty of what I would consider to be awesome bands, some of which were just mentioned by Cless, which will not start a revolution, but can vastly influence individual people and stuff like that.  I mean, does it really matter if the majority of the populous doesn't recognize a band as being important because they've never heard of them?  The reality of tomorrow's music could be shaped by the Evanescence and Hoobastank of today, I wouldn't say that makes them great.  Like when you say that Shania Twain probably did a lot for country music, think about what she actually helped chang it into.  She most likely just helped push it into the mainstream; not by bringing the mainstream to country, either, but by conforming to the mainstream.  Whereas she may have done a lot for what country music is going to become, I wouldn't say that she did a lot of GOOD for it.<br /><br />And as far as today's scope of "revolutionary" goes, I think that we're really focusing on a very minute piece of what music is.  Our idea of revolutionary music might be something more along the lines of changing popular music from poppy rock to depressing rock, rather than jazz to rock, or something like that.  I mean, what about the evolution musical notation?  The advent of polyphony?  The invention of the piano?  Now THOSE were revolutionary.  Who knows, maybe the music of the future will be lyricless?<br /><br />After that schpeel, I hope some of you might re-evaluate your ideas of what makes music good, just kind of expand your views or something.  Not a sermon, just a thought.<br />

          I don't think bands albums put out by the Beetles and Hendrix or even the Beach Boys and Johnny Cash are great because of just solely their music. They have been out for decades(over and people still talk about them. People are still obsessed with them. They have stood the test of time. <br /><br />40 to 50 years from now are people still going to be talking about bands like Modest Mouse or Death cab for cutie? Probably not. They aren't taking the world by storm and doing new and inventive things to the extent where they might revolutionize the entire music industry. They are decent bands, but they aren't even comparable to the greats yet and they have had a few albums to prove themselves. <br /><br />The only modern bands that I can think of off the top of my head that might be in this "great" category are probably Nirvana and Sublime, respectively. I guess Shania Twain and Garth Brookes have done a lot for country music. The Jackson Five isn't really modern anymore, but they got these poppy boy band types rolling and Michael Jackson definitely did some amazing things in the 70s-80s.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is great bands need to be really amazing in the sense that not only their music is good, but they can affect the music that comes after them and completely change the way people look at the genre and they HAVE to be remembered way down the line. My post is turning into a ramble so I'm gonna cut off now. <br />

          I actually think we're in agreement, TuuK, about the talent thing; maybe you just read me wrong. What you said about "clone" bands is exactly what I think is wrong with American music, which is what I was saying when I was talking about homogenizationâ€”everyone sounds the same. What I meant about new talent (and diverse talent) is that record companies NEED to start finding bands like that, not that they have been (because, quite obviously they haven't). People are tired of the dreck that's been out there for years now; record companies have to start finding bands that people want to pay for, bands that have real talent and originality. They also need to stop signing everyone who's moderately good, because there are a lot of duds out there for the few huge bands that bring in all the cash.<br /><br />Also, I take issue with your assertion that the last time that really great bands were found in a short period of time was the 60's. There's a lot of exciting stuff happening in the post-rock and indie scene right now: bands like Broken Social Scene, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur RÃ³s, Modest Mouse, Death Cab For Cutie (who've both now hit the big time, relatively speaking), The Shins, Belle & Sebastian... There's a lot of neat new music coming out these days that's very different from the nu-metal vs. pop sameness of the late 90s. Yes, there were some really fantastic bands from the 60's, but let's not write off all the cool new artists.<br /><br />And to Kobold, I know that digital quality is quite good these days, but digital is just a means to an ends (as you pointed out). Yes, 24-bit, 192KHz is very high sampling, and indistinguishable from the original to today's listeners. I was just mentioning that the best technically produced album of all time was made in the 60's, before digital ever hit the scene. I'm not a real analog vs. digital Nazi. I won't break into your house and smash your CD player and replace it with a Linn Sondek LP12â€”I'd go broke very quicklyâ€”but I think there's a misperception by the general public that "digital = better" automatically, which is of course a fallacy. Excellent sound quality can be obtained by either.<br /><br />To be fair, there is some pretty impressive home studio gear available these days. Most people can afford at least some decent quality gear for a few thousand dollars. But I have yet to hear a home-produced album whose mixing and mastering can match up to studio work by professionals. It's just a different level. In fact, even though I like their music, I find it hard to listen to Death Cab For Cutie and Modest Mouse's earlier albums, which simply aren't as well-produced as their latest, major label offerings. I just wish that all the neat new bands had that opportunity the first time out, by demonstrating talent on demos and being adequately marketed by the labels.<br /><br />And now that that's out of the way, I have to wait for one of you bastards to post again so I can tell the incredibly ridiculous story of my own stupidity yesterday, so I won't look like a front-page whore.<br />

             Cless, I'm a bit confused here.  You wrote in your last post that, "(Tuuk's) assertion that someone in their home can record music at higher quality than most professional studio albums of the past is wishful thinking," but the 24-bit, 192 kHz recording you take note of a few sentences later is a modern standard of quality.  What Tuuk was referring to in terms of recording quality, I believe, were "most of the greatest albums of all time," which can most widely be considered to have not all been "modern" albums.<br /><br />   I guess what I'm saying is, that while the analog productions of thirty years ago may be superior to most digtital home studios of today, your post really didn't support that particular argument with fact... but, I might just be reading it wrong. <br /><br />   Anyway, I had a Recording Technology professor who vastly prefers the quality of analog to digital recordings... he always likes to remind everyone in this computer-studio age of the excellece of integrity that comes with recording on a big-ole 1-inch 16-track reel at 32 IPS and that sort of thing.  But regardless of which will win in the battle of digital versus analog, I find that either will suit me just fine.  The reason is simple: both high-quality analog and high-quality digital recordings are too good for whatever CD player or what-have-you that I can afford to play my music on.  Could I hear a difference on awesome speakers?  Probably.  But do I have those speakers?  No.  Why don't I have those speakers?  Because I'm a goddam poor musician, that's why.<br /><br />   Maybe I've gotten a little of topic, but I think the new moral of this story is: if you like music, don't be a musician.

          I'm going to make this very short so I can make like horsecrap and hit the hay. The E3R team met up tonight and discussed some of the issues that needed to be addressed: comments on E3R posts, new handling of E3R Applications, and other stuff that you don't really give a poop about. Here are the results.<br /><br /><strong>Comments:</strong> while comments are not being taken out of posts, they ARE being defaultly disabled. Every post will be able to have the comment capability but the author of the post must click on "More Posting Options" and select that commenting on that specific post is allowed. This will keep <i>some</i> of the problems at bay. Cless and I are going to work on instructions on balance between Blogging and Commenting but basically it goes a little like this: Look pal, if your comment is more than 4 lines in length, you need to BTFU and post it. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3563019">Need help with instructions on how to contribute anonymously?</a> <br /><br /><strong>E3R Application Handling:</strong> all members of E3R should try to look for other new possible posters to keep the spirit alive around here. All Applications sent in till this point have been accepted majorly because these accounts were writers for E3R before. Now, we have just about all of our old posters back and there are some new people who are asking for access. These will need time to process because instead of just copying an email address and sending an invite, the application is forwarded to every member of DLS where I wait for an OKAY or a NOKAY (just made that word up. funny? yes?).<br /><br />As far as everything else, its still up in the air. We may be porting to a new posting system people. I'm sure you're going to be so happy over that. Comments are welcome, but post responses are too.<br />

          Oy TuuK, how about investing in some paragraphs? I hear they're priced to move in bulk, and very easy to use. And they have the most intuitive interface after the nipple (and before MacOS X). Okay, time to correct some things in your rant. Good work on it, by the way, it's nice and long. However, there's a few problems with it.<br /><br />First, the deteriorating CDs thing is bunk. I've got many CDs in my collection (bought by my father) from 1986 that are still in perfect condition, nearly 18 years after their pressingsâ€”and that's with heavy but careful use in stereo CD players, long before computers could handle compression and playback of CD-quality audio. Compact discs that DO deteriorate are CD-Rs, due to the cheapness of the materials involved. However, pressed CDs (the silver kind you buy) will last effectively forever (MANY generations of hardware into the future). The only pressed CDs that WILL deteriorate are VERY early CDs (from the early 1980s) which used inks that ate away at the top polycarbonate layer or had aluminum layers which extended all the way to the edge of the discs. Any CD made after about 1984 or so does not have either of these problems.<br /><br />Secondly, the cost of CDs isn't just because record companies are greedy (though that does have to do with it)â€”it's more a result of the broken way in which record companies spend their money looking for and hiring talent. The truth is it doesn't take as much as you'd think to get "signed." The problem is how the record companies go about business after that. In order for an artist to record, mix, and master an album in a professional studio, they need lots of money, money they often cannot raise themselves. When an artist is signed, the record company loans them the money necessary to record the album and distribute it. Then the artist is responsible for paying that loan back, through profits obtained from the album being sold and/or touring if the album doesn't sell well enough. Only the very biggest bands (a very tiny proportion of those signed) make royalty profits from their workâ€”at most 5%, usually around 1 - 2%. Even then, the record companies keep much of THEIR money because they have to subsidize all the artists who didn't sell. This subsidizing system is what keeps only but a very few artists from becoming incredibly successful. As a result, only these bands or artists are marketed heavily, leading to the homogenization of the radio airwaves and music in general.<br /><br />The real answer is that the record company system and all the baggage that's come along with it is fundamentally broken. So yes, they are afraid of the Internet, but not because CD sales are down. In fact, any independent study will show that CD sales have been on the rise recently. The reason record companies are afraid of the Internet (and thus forcing online music distributors to DRM their wares) is because it represents a fundamental shift in power away from the big faceless industry and more towards truly innovative artists.<br /><br />Finally, your assertion that someone in their home can record music at higher quality than most professional studio albums of the past is wishful thinking. Maybe your ears can't hear the difference between audio recorded on a prosumer-grade 16-bit, 44KHz sound card and mastered at that level throughout, but mine certainly can. Studios are built to incredibly detailed specifications, utilizing only the best in microphones and digital (or analogue) recording equipment. Modern albums are recorded, mixed, and mastered at 24-bit, 192KHz, and downsampled for distribution on CD. Compressed music has beaten the public's ears into submission; 128Kbps MP3 is NOT CD-quality by any stretch of the imagination. Is it good enough to fool most people? Yes, but it certainly doesn't rival the production quality of, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005ASHM/qid=1087429739/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-4999834-1113746?v=glance&s=music&n=507846" target="_new">the album by which all others are judged</a>, recorded long before digital hit the scene. Well-maintained vinyl played on hi-fi equipment can easily rival the sound of CDs played on equipment of much higher price.<br /><br />All that aside, I'm of the opinion that the American music world won't be redeemed of the mass-produced dreck that has infected it for the greater part of 20 years until ClearChannel goes out of business, record labels stop signing so many mediocre artists and thus require stars to subsidize their failures, and Internet distributors stop treating consumers like criminals before they've committed a crime. Value added services, attention to talented local artists, and a broadening to the musical palette exposed to the public will free us from the Top 40 mentality of American pop.<br />

          So, today just happens to be my big sister's birthday, and I know that some of you know her, so I just wanted to do a shout out to her on this special day.  So Rachel, I hope you have the happiest birthday ever in sunny Florida.  Yeah, she's doing some neuroscience studies at FSU in Tallahassee (I'm jealous).  I always knew she was the smarty pants of the family.  So anyone else that knows her and cares at all, please leave a comment on this wishing her a great birthday...it would mean a lot to her being so far away from friends and family.  <br /><br />In other news, I highly recommend that you listen to Joe's audio post that he made earlier today.  It makes you want to never buy a huge suitcase again.  That is all.<br />

Thanks guys!<br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT E3R NEWS:</b> ALL DEVLOGIKSYMBIOT MEMBERS WILL BE DISCUSSING LAYOUT ISSUES & MEMBER ACCOUNT DETAILS. I have some issues with comments on posts for E3R.

          There's something about working this job that seems a bit strange. While I don't know <i>everything</i> I think I should know at this point I still feel like I'm doin a pretty damn good job of adapting. I feel as if I have already been workin this job for a month and its not tiresome. I wake up @ 6am, shower, pick out something to wear and then I'm off on the metro. I'm like the rest of the sheep; not speaking, just moving and making wierd sounds-- out of our iPods and cellphone notifications.<br /><br />There's a definate pattern emerging already I see- and I can see how this would drive someone mad after 10 years. Everything in the city is so automatic that it almost forces you into an unbreakable loop, where your life plays before your eyes because the ground you stand on is actually a stair thats mechanically pushing you forward. "But what if I don't want to move forward?" somebody says. Well, you don't have that choice. You can walk backwards but you're just going to bump into a bunch of metro cowboys and if you refuse to take these automatic stairs you cannot leave at all. Just turn around and hop back on the train which will inevitably drop you off at another place just like the last with funky stairs awaiting.<br /><br />But I like automatic stairs.<br /><br />I suppose if it weren't for escalators the handicapped people would slow everybody down- and you can smell it here: time is money and its just burning away when we're all standing still. When you exit the metro you're greeted with new smells, new people, sounds, etc. Somebody is always trying to bum a dollar off of you. I have reached a dangerous point in my balances where I have taped up both my Credit/Debit cards and I am holding onto my metro card for dear life. I have more money on my metro card than I do in all of my accounts. I have decided to pack my lunch. Not only will this teach me discipline, but it will also give me better control over what I'm putting in my body. When you go out to a restaurant, they don't care how the meal is prepared as long as it tastes VERY GOOD then everything is okay. Thats why fat people think they're doin good by getting the lesser of the fattening buckets of grease but both are just as bad-- the only difference is the one you ordered has a splash of lettuce.<br /><br />Already, I find myself adapting to this new environment. I knew I would and that it was only a matter of time but I have only been here for approximately 5 days. I already know how to talk to people and how they will talk to me. There is one thing you don't need to bring up in a conversation @ D.C. and that's politics. You know why? Because the other person will.<br /><br />I was sitting in the park today watching the herds of people cross the street over and over again. An old man squabbles by, tips his hat to me, and plops down on the other side of the bench. He had shorts on, glasses just like my grandfather, and a loose black shirt. He seemed like a nice old man. That is, until he spoke. Thats when I came to the conclusion that I was speaking to an old dirty bastard.<blockquote>ODB: HUMID AS HELL, aint it?<br />Me: why yes *padding down fro* yes it sure seems to be.<br />Brain: Joe, it's 7:20 in the morning. WTF are you doing speaking to somebody at 7:20 in the morning?<br />ODB: Boy, you'd think after all the money they spent on this park they would get the shit straight, right?<br />[He points to the curb where it looks pretty good to me but then where it looks like it should continue, it suddenly stops.]<br />Me: It is a little incomplete, in my opinion.<br />ODB: Incomplete? It's fucked up man. They fucked up in this park. At least they have enough benches. God damn, how many people do they expect to sit down at once?<br />Me: I dunno. People don't look like they make a habit of sitting...<br />ODB: The hell they do. They sit all day.<br />[He then points to the middle of the park where there is a statue of a man, which is surrounded by small cannons.]<br />ODB: You know those are real fucking cannons?<br />Me: Really? No, I didn't know that.<br />ODB: Yup, they're (insert long military code-name)ers small little things but if they hit you...<br />Me: yeah...<br />ODB: They'd fuck you up.<br />Brain: Run. This dude is crazy. Pull his hat lid down over his eyes, and run like a little girl.<br />Joe: Well, I got to head in. Nice talkin' to ya.<br />ODB: Yeah Buddy, nice talkin to you too.</blockquote>And so it came at last, I made a new friend in the big city. <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> Seriously though, if there are any E3R readers that live in the Ballston area of Arlington, <a href="mailto:e3rjb@msn.com">give me a holla</a>.

          Things to do before 12am:<blockquote>1. find some sort of bag to carry lunch in.<br />2. assemble a playlist for my PDA so I blend in a little better with the crowd listening to iPods on the metro.<br />3. brush teeth.<br />4. read the news from 4 different sources just to find its all the same.<br />5. look to my right to see which combination of clothing I'm going to wear for work tommorrow.<br />6. check out weather.com to confirm thats what I want to wear to only realize I really don't have a choice as to what I want to wear.<br />7. check email. check it again just in case someone sent me something besides an E3R application (btw, more people have recieved accounts but haven't posted yet. post damnit!)<br />8. make a couple stupid faces into the webcam.<br />9. hit the sack.<br />10. go to bed.</blockquote>Life is bliss when you're stupid.<br />
