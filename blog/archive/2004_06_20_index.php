          A woman dressed head to toe in red, white, and blue walked into the gift shop where I work the other day. She finally picked up a pair of bookends and brought them to the front counter.  She sat them down and examined them in great detail.  After a few moments she scrunched up her nose and said, "It says MADE IN CHINA right on the front of these, my husband hates that."  I said, "I know how that is.  We sometimes have customers that come in and only want things that are made in America."  Her next words were something I will never forget.  "Well, you know, it just makes you think of people killing prisoners for their organs."  I had nothing to say and just rung up her purchase (which did not include the bookends.)  What the fuck did that statement mean?  Some people are just freakin weird, they should die. <br /><br /><br />By the way FSEVN, sorry, I didn't mean to get you sick...hope you feel better!<br />

          Being sick is the worst feeling ever. It is atleast when you are at the point when you feel really nauseous <s>(sp?)</s>. I've been stabbed, burned, had an entire tree fall on me (that's where I first learned that when you cut down a tree shouting "TIMBER!" is for everyone including yourself), and I've had my groin stomped on. Damn, people are cruel, but I'm sure it was funny for them. Anyway I'd go through any of those again if I never had to feel nauseous ever anymore. I guess that's part of why I don't drink so much anymore. <br /><br /><i>edited by FSEVN @ 2:39pm. Note: We do have a built in Spell-Checking mechanism @ the posting interface.

          ...and it sucks. All of that not sleepin' and not eatin' thing is totally backfiring on me today. I'm weak, tired, and sick. Or about to be sick. You know that feeling your nose gives ya, right before a day of hell on earth? Yeah, it's like a beacon; a batsignal of sorts to let me know "yeah buddy, I'll be your worst enemy tommorrow."

          I think I figured out why FSEVN went to the Tom Jones concert.  The other day, he mentioned that he had a mountain of work and almost jumped out a window, when he remembered a certain WWDC.  Clearly, this was a typo, and he meant "WWJD";  What Would Jesus Do?  Well, Jesus would do what any good soul would do, which is to go to the Tom Jones concert.  Knowing this, FSEVN knew that he, too, should be in attendance.  Also, he really likes "What's New Pussycat".<br /><br />Also, I'm sorry to hear about your unnoticed birthday, FSEVN.  I'm sure Jesus remembered it.  My 20th birthday is today though, and since you haven't called, you can't be mad at me for not calling you.  <br /><br />Dear Tuuk,<br />I disagree with your calling "Dark Side of the Moon" the greatest album of all time.  With regards to certain aspects of popluarity or sales, it may be, but I think that calling it the greatest album of all time might be a bit presumptuous.<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure I understand your saying that Western music is not typically mathematical while Eastern music is.  As I understand, and please, correct me if I'm wrong, today's system of 12 notes and their relationships (known as "equal temperament") is based on the octave (doubling of frequency, as in a "C" up to the next closest "C") being split into 12 equal intervals called half-steps (the smallest practical interval).  The relationships of the frequencies of sequential half-steps are based on an exponential scale... anyway, I'm usually too much of a dunce to understand this stuff well enough to truly explain it, but it works out that a half-step above one note's frequency is the 12th root of 2 (about 1.0595) larger.  Following this sequence, 5 half-steps (a perfect 4th) vibrates at a ratio of about 4:3 with the tonic (original) pitch, just as 7 half-steps (a perfect 5th) is about a 3:2 ratio, and 12 half-steps (a perfect octave) vibrates at a ratio of exactly 2:1.  What this means, I believe, is that some pitch intervals (such as these "perfect" intervals) are naturally more harmonious because of the closeness of these relationships... umm... that is to say, that 3:2 is more easy on the ears than the square root of 2:1 (a tritone).  So, yeah, I just kind of confused myself, because I really didn't write that in an entirely coherent manner.  Do with it what ye will, anyway.  <br /><br />Sorry for the drawn-outedness of this post.  Me go sleepy-sleep now.<br />

          Ok, I ordered a webcam type thing from logitech about 2 and 1/2 weeks ago (online). Basically, after two weeks I decided to check on what was taking so long because I was told it wouldn't take longer than that to arrive at my home. I'm looking at the tracking page and I see that it was in my town and it says it was delived and signed for by some fucker named M. Watkins. I can assure you I am not him nor have I ever heard of him. I made sure my address was right and it was. I sent an email to logitech asking them what was up and they just reworded exactly what I told them. "M. Watkins signed for the product delivered to <my address>."<br /><br />Now what the fuck do I do? I intend to call them tomorrow, assuming they sent me some automated answer. What happens to the guy that signed for my mail? Is that tampering with someone elses mail? He signed for a package at the wrong address and under a name not even remotely similar to mine. Is FedEX or Logitech to blame? How can I go about getting my money back or the actual freaking product. <br /><br />Damn, incompetance pisses me off!<br />

I accomplished in 3 days what would have taken another intern a month(?) or so and so now everybody jumpin on me to do all kinds of crazy stuff. For example, here is one conversation I had today with the licensing director, who we (for all intensive purposes) will call "F". She is introducing me to another female worker in the licensing department ("K").<blockquote>F: K, this is Joseph Burdick, the new intern for us and media to share.<br />Brain: ooo, goodie-- there's nothing more gratifying than breaking multiple deadlines simultaneously.<br />K: Hello.<br />Me: Hi, nice to meet ya *shakes hand*<br />F: He is said to be fast, efficient, adaptive, and creative.<br />K: Excellent!<br />Brain: coulda fooled me.<br />F: Okay Joseph, here's your mountain of work.<br />Me: HOLY ISHT!<br /><end of conversation as I died instantly from my chest collapsing due to the weight of the paperwork handed over to me by the 40 year old woman.></blockquote>Yeah, wow, I have never seen so many deadlines open at the same time. This, I know now, <em>IS</em> the real world. The other stuff I have done has been the real world as well but, luckily, I was so skilled in those things I foolishly finished them quickly. <br /><br />I actually began to panic at my desk. I sat there, clicking away at various things to find contact information for over 300 people & corporations-- eyes wide and heart pumping. See, when I get to panic in a public area like this, I don't scream, sweat, or cry like most people. No, I start laughing like a mad-man thinking how the _____ am I going to pull this off.<blockquote>Brain: you know, Joe. You're on the 13th floor. You run out of that window across the hall and say bye bye to all of these deadlines!</blockquote>No, wouldn't want to land on anybody or cause a gruesome scene that blocks traffic worse than Reagan's soul chamber. Plus, why would I OFF myself with the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> right around the corner? Oh well, the plan is to start on the right foot tommorrow and start making calls. I promised myself I wouldn't post very much here right now since I'm so pooped but damned if I didn't. <br /><strong>Things I could crap on today:</strong> misinformation on unwritten private computer & network policies. If I get another message as to what I can and can't do in my office, I'm going to walk in on Friday with my 500lbs SCSI Raid system, turn the bitch on and take out all of the power in Washington D.C. Hoo<em>ha</em>!<br /><strong>Things I could smile about today:</strong> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,116591,00.asp">news that laptops will soon be powered by fuel cells</a>. Why not just crash your windows machine when you can make it totally explode!<br />

          I got me a Gmail account. Woo!<br /><br />Beelo, I can't really combat all your points. I'll almost certainly never use all 1GB of the storage capacity. I hate spam with a passion, and thus try to direct all of it to Hotmail by signing up for non-essential stuff online using THAT address. I really just wanted a Gmail account for cool points and to try a new name/handle I'm thinking of switching to without having to append piles of numbers or such. Four years of Cless has gotten a bit boring. Plus, there are a fair number of Clesses online.<br /><br />That said, I will take you up on the offer to call you naive.<br /><br />*ahem* You are naive.<br /><br />..\/,  <3  and : )<br />

          7:40 A.M. --- it’s Monday and I am up at this horrific time.  And to make matters worse, I don’t NEED to be up, at least not for the next 9 hours.  I tried to go back to sleep but wasn’t able to.  **gag** <br /><br />On the bright side of things, I received my first roommate in college.  However, she is just here for one night.  How odd it that?!  She apparently is apart of the whole Kings Dominion thing that is going on in my dorm.        KD:  They bus a whole bunch of foreign kids: Taiwanese, German, French, Slovaks, and other various countries.  Going into the lounge is weird because you hear English mostly from the TV they are watching. **Shrug** Now, for the next 7 weeks I’m apart of the “mixing bowl” that is Rhoads Hall.<br /><br />

          <img src="http://www.thebroadwaycollection.com/images/shows/12/showpic_12.jpg" hspace="3" align="right">Well, it's Sunday and boy am I ready for some hardcore sleepin' action. My birthday was on Friday and Morg and I went to see STOMP at Richmond's Landmark Theatre. It was totally awesome. The beats were right up my alley. It was like...industrial techno without the computers. When Morgan asked me how I liked it my official response was "I have never been so entertained in my life." Very cool show, if any of you have any extra cash at the given time that STOMP is performing in your area, go check it out. <br /><br />In other entertaining news, none of my family members called me on my birthday. I found this so funny that I decided to start calling <i>them</i>. All I got was voicemail and even then, I never got a response until the next day. <i>Glad to see you people are on top of things, thanks!</i> I didn't even want anything except for a "happy birthday" from the people who were responsible for it. But, no deal. My mom said, "you know me, son. I was too busy, sorry!" and my dad said, "I was going to call you...but I fell asleep instead." My uncle, the one that I'm staying with right now for this internship had no clue that my birthday was on Friday and was still confused as to which day it was on until I came back tonight and cleared it up for him. I had to use my own money for dinner (except for what morgan bought me in pity [thanks morgan!] and now the money that I spent I owe to <i>myself</i> due to lack of funds and the required money for costly gas and metro tickets. <br /><br />After the show, we picked up some <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3586520">friends</a> around the area and would have had more but a certain <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3571803">two</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3571753">significants</a> weren't in town. We went to Denny's for dinner which was fine with me and soon called it a night. Morgan was sick most of the weekend so she wasn't having as much fun as she could have had but went with the flow of things anyway. <blockquote><b>Things that must be frowned upon this weekend:</b> parking tickets, gas prices, friends who call you when you're in town just to get a ride to some place. All equally annoying. And if you reading this and you're responsible for any of these things, go pat yourself on the back, ass.<br /><b>Things that must be smiled upon this weekend:</b> families that enjoy you more than your own, playing guitar with skilled drummer, eating enough 'complimentary birthday dessert dishes' to make Dr. Phil go into a seizure.</blockquote> By the way, when I'm talking about "family" I'm talkin intermediate family not my ultra-fabulous-adopted-aunt/uncle family. Confused? Get used to it, and no, I don't live in West Virginia. <br />

          I've decided that I need to rekindle my interest in music, just really relearn to love it.  In doing so, I've realized that I don't - I can't - care about whether or not what I listen to is popular, or "good", or anything like that.  I am very much in agreement with Tuuk about music as having some sort of ineffable ability to move a particluar person, even while leaving others unaffected.  Alas, as a student of music, I've been trained to not accept certain configurations of sound as being music (I just tried to explain to a friend a few weeks ago why certain sound combinations are mathematically undesirable), or well-written music at the very least.  But, dammit, it's downright discouraging to hear someone tell you that something you feel very influenced by is crap, and I hear it all the time.  I hate that, and I have to actively catch myself from doing it sometimes.  Music should be a subjective thing, and everyone should probably stop trying to simplify or quantify it.<br /><br />I've kind of always thought this way, and now I'm just reassuring myself in saying this.  I believe it was a man by the name of Marshall Mathers who once said, "You think I give a damn about a Grammy?"  Who cares what's popular?  An hour or two ago I played through Vivaldi's "L'Inverno (winter) Concerto";  Will mainstream America request it for the Top 40 with Casey Kasem?  Not a chance, but I request it.  I like it, and it makes me happy.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be insensitive to other people's choices in music, and what music makes them happy, I'm just saying that what makes one body happy may not work for another.  And now I'm going to work some more on my remix of Europe's "Final Countdown", and you're not going to say anything about it.<br />

          Is the music industry really in such a sad state these days, as some people claim it is?<br /><br />That all depends on how you look at it.<br /><br />Turn on the radio, turn on MTV, flip through a copy of Rollingstone, and you'll most likely only see and here slosh that all sounds pretty much the same.  Videos of scantilly clad super models shaking their round patooshes while a "tru thug" raps only about sex and money, guys in their 30's whining through their nose about a highschool break up, a guy in a cowboy hat bragging about his pickup truck and the number of beers he tossed back the night before:  this is corporate rock.  This is popular because of the whole "do what worked well in the past" method.  As mentioned in an earlier post, this started almost as soon as rock started (monkees playing like the beatles).  In the past 10 years, this method has become used to such an extent, that its damn near impossible to find any original, true alternative music(otherwise known as good music) without turning off your radio or mtv.  It's all an unfortunate byproduct of capitalism and media merging.  For example, i'm sure most of you have heard of Clear Channel, a company that owns the majority of all the radio stations IN THE WORLD.  Their ideology, being a monopoly and all, is to make as much money as possible while bumping off all competition.  What's popular in one region will be popular in another region, and every region, to infinite; that is, if their radio stations force it down your throat for long enough.  This is why you turn on a rock station somewhere on the west coast and it sounds exactly the same as a rock station on the east coast.<br /><br />What worries me about this, as stated somewhere above, is the general message that seems to be found in all the music that populates the airwaves these days: that of superficiality and materialsim.  Lets face it: kids like whatever older people tell them are cool.  When they see Jay-z on MTV telling us how cool it is to be a pimp and make money, they're getting the wrong message.  Christina Aguileria bumping around practically naked and humping the camera while 11 year old girls take notes.  There doesnt seem to be any substance in this type of music.  Their messages are appallingly shallow.  And this is what the younger generation is being raised on.  I mean, when i was 12, i watched hours of MTV a day.  I was fortunate enough to have grown up though when mainstream music actually meant something more than trying to get laid (or complaining about not getting laid, for all you emo kids).  <br /><br />This is not saying that these kids won't ever see past this veil the music industry has thrown across our impressionable young faces; afterall, classic rock stations are still fairly decent, and that right there is the stepping stone to hoist your way out of the corporate rock abyss.  And there are certainly lots of great modern bands out there, with lyrics that actually, *gasp*, make you think.  And there is hope.  <br /><br />My point is: To get to the good stuff, you have to find your way through all the bad stuff.  And as thick as the wall of mainstream music is today, i fear that younger generations may never discover bands like Joy Division, The Smiths, and Radiohead.<br /><br />Thats all for now.<br />
