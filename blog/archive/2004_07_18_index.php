          I agree, FSEVN, cars are more trouble than they're worth.  That's why I have a plan for alternate transportation in the works:<br /> <br /> This monkey is probably the first of many to begin walking upright.  Indeed, this is no doubt the start of a sort of "Monkey Revolution", whereby all monkeys will become what I would refer to as "fine, upstanding citizens"; that is to say, they will walk around, shop at stores, vote, pay taxes, watch VH1, that sort of thing.  They will most likely also ride around in PowerWheels or use pogo sticks and hangliders to get around from place to place.  It'll be cute at first, but is this really the kind of world we want to live in?<br /> <br /> Of course not!  Which is why I propose a plan which I call "Monkey Servitude".  In this plan, monkeys would serve us food and make our beds as Monkey Butlers.  I am also currently working on plans for Monkey Lifeguards, Monkey Musicians, Monkey Zookeepers, Monkey Civil Engineers (i always wanted a treehouse), the MBA, or "Monkey Basketball Association", and, the solution to all our transportation woes, the Monkey Rickshaw Puller.  <br /> <br /> Some may call many of these Monkey Occupations "inhumane", but I disagree.  I strongly believe that these monkeys are simply looking for some direction and structure in their lives, and we should do what we can to provide that for them.  Also, they would be payed in bananas, and they'd like that. <br /> <br /> So remember, there's nothing wrong with Monkey Rickshaws.  It's really only a matter of time before we're pulling <span style="font-style: italic;">them</span> around in rickshaws, so we need to take some initiative here.<br /> <br />

          The secret number of the day is <span style="font-weight: bold;">17</span>. You all will probably never find out why I have started archiving every weekday but deal with it. The number itself isn't secret just the meaning behind it. ba ha, <span style="font-style: italic;">secret</span>.<br /> <br /> Sara's back! Been at band camp all this time eh? I just emailed you the other day because we keep getting hits from google by people searching for your posting name. Strange but true. No one ever searches for me. Anyhoo, glad to see you're back and you haven't...ya know...died of SARS or anything. Welcome! *blows a party horn*<br /> <br /> So my sister will be coming into town on Saturday (tommorrow). It will be pretty strange ya know since I hardly see her and now she's growing up so god damn fast. She's like 17 now and her personality seems to have developed a lot since the last time I saw her. But we're going to have a fun, figure out what each other has been up to for the past two years, and simply chill. So thats good.<br /> <br /> In two weeks, I return back to school. However, I may not be returning with my car. In order to get the best of the best system for my major I have sacrificed my car. I plan on parking it somewhere--as long I don't have to pay insurance on it. So I will be living in Richmond, crime boss of the east siiiide, without my car. Guess I'll have to start packing groceries and ride on my bike and that certainly takes care of the whole taxi issue. Gas is too faareaking expensive anyway. What will I do if something happens and I need to escape Richmond? I'll either tag along with Morg or if that <span style="font-style: italic;">isn't an option </span>I'll just take a bus or try to catch a ride with someone else heading up north and pay 'em 20$ or something. I hardly use my car anyway, it just sits there and looks ugly. I always have a fear someone is outside in the process of stealing it but they never do...if they ever hit the gas the whole front of the car would probably blow up. Or they could just turn off the A/C to try to conserve gas in their getaway and suddenly the AC compressor would grind against metal, stopping the belt that helps drive a part of the engine block, stopping it completely. Or, perhaps, the pending recalls would finally popup and he would try to screetch onto main street only to find out that the steering wheel has detached and he's heading straight into "the border" a nice looking bar that I haven't had the chance to eat at yet. Or of course, the other recall, where he turns the ignition which suddely turns into a car bomb light that leaves nothing except the frame of a shitty car with two skeleton hands still clinging on. <br /> <br /> I hate cars. <br /> <br /> I wish we could go back to horse buggies. That would be nice. Of course there is the whole speed issue, and horses can only pull at certain amount before getting fatigued. Thats why the future horse buggies would have horses cracked out on adderol and give them Nike shoes. Eh, throw a rocket pack on the back of the buggy powered by fuel cell batteries and Nitro. Eh, just put the horses in the back of the Ford F-150 and say you everything else. Ah damn.<br /> <br /> People from Tha Dirtay Souf are funny. I can pick out 9 times out of 10 a chick who is from the south. You know how? she'll walk with her elbows bent at a 90 degree angle at all times. And she'll be missing tendons in her wrists. Men, eh I dunno I don't follow them too much. Strange creatures, men are. Glad I'm not one of em.<br /> <br /> Today at work I came in to ask my supervisor a number of business-related questions, deadlines, ya know...important stuff. Dialog went something like this:<blockquote>Joe: Hello M, what kind of deadlines am I facing for next week? When do you want the rest of my commercial proposals? When are the ArchiveOne guys coming back to take those vids to storage? What is goi...<br /> M: It'll all be taken care of Monday. How are <span style="font-weight: bold;">you</span> doing?<br /> Brain: ERROR! ERROR! YOU HAVE PERFORMED AN ILLEGAL OPERATION AND THIS SYSTEM MUST BE SHUT DOWN AND RESTARTED. [head starts spinning]<br /> Joe: Me? uhmm.....*shugs*....you know.....*shrugs*. I'm fine.<br /> M: I like to keep up with whats going on in people's lives too, are you okay?<br /> Joe: oh yea sure....umm....I just don't usually have people ask me that and ya know...actually be curious. Usually its more of a content filler or...an attempt to not be rude.<br /> M: uh huh. (a couple of seconds pass of silence) SO?!<br /> Joe: what!?<br /> M: Answer my question, damnit.<br /> Joe: oh umm...I'm good. Do you have Mary's number? She's not in her office.<br /> M: *sighs* No. You're pretty funny, Joe. Now get out of my office.</blockquote>What is a guy supposed to do? I don't just tell people about my personal life-- especially when I know that my stay is temporary. She's a nice lady though. She knows my uncle and I guess she may know that currently I have a lot on my plate. But what can you do? Take life one step at a time and remember to take the Orange Line and not the god damn Blue one. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br /><br />

You are hanging out in the trees with all of your monkey friends, eatin' nanners and just havin a great old time.  One day, you eat something that doesn't quite sit will in your little monkey stomach. You crawl into a corner and sit there for a while until one of the zoo people come up and take you in, monitoring you with all of these wires and such. You come close to death and your stomach pains you so...you begin to think that you are going to die and the zoo people think the same. Everything looks very grim for you. You fall asleep one night just wishing it would come while you slept but it doesn't. You wake up one day and your stomach feels fine. You go to stand up and...something's very different. You lean on your knuckles like you normally do and you almost fall forward at first. You lean back, bend your knees, and stand up. You've stood up before but only for a short while because it felt funny. But now, you're on top of the world. Suddenly you walk just like the retards that come to see you everyday at the zoo. What happened to you? Is there something wrong with you? Or is there something <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>? <br /> <br /> After dancing to the can-can to all of your human customers the next thing on your list is to stop that awful habit of pooping in your hand and throwing it at little girls. <span style="font-style: italic;">Little girls wearing bows in their hair and/or dresses to match are worth bonus points.<br /> <br /> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is this?</span> I don't know. The monkey seems to be fine now except for the fact that it prefers to stand on two legs instead of four. Is this evolution? Is this a mutation? Is this monkey just messed up in the head? I want to hear what you have to say. No matter what your religious affiliation or scientific opinion is, you just can't tell me that the picture of that monkey is not just the funniest damn thing you have ever seen. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br /> </span><br />

          Seriously man, what's the deal with exploding?  It's so... senior class of 2002.  Imploding is all the rage these days!<br /> <br /> FSEVN, in response to your "guys with funny names section", I worked at a 411-information call center for about a week, and I had access to some funny names that I could laugh at on my downtime.  The only one I really remember is when I typed "Dude" into the search engine, and it came back with this listing for "Dinwiddie Old Dude"... and it was a residential listing.  Therefore, there must be some guy in the midatlantic region whose name is "Dinwiddie Old Dude".  And he's my hero.<br /> <br />

          <blockquote>"wtfdtm?"<br />"lmfaorofl."</blockquote><img src="http://www.tritronicsinc.com/battery/digibatt.jpg" style="border:1px solid #000000;" align="left" hspace="3">A couple days ago, I was sitting in a meeting at the long executive table listening to these Vocus people spout about their new software enhancements and my stomach began feeling really crummy. Then, I began to notice that swallowing was a little different and I had a copper taste in the back of my throat. As soon as the meeting was over, I walked quickly to the bathroom. I began trying to cough up what I had been swallowing for 20 minutes or so and I looked at the paper towel to see it was spattered with blood.<blockquote>Brain: Blood? Hmm, thats wierd. Usually it comes out of peoples' noses not...you know...their mouth.</blockquote>Lately, because I did so much work during my first couple weeks at NCPC, I have been doing extremely boring work. Like *real* intern stuff. Another one of my supervisors discovered me doing these trivial tasks and was became very irritated. Her identity will be represented by the letter "M".<blockquote>M: Just what in the hell are you doing?<br />Joe: cutting and pasting...oldschool style.<br />M: Don't they have...stickers? that you can just PRINT on?<br />Joe: Stickers? What sorcery is this?!?</blockquote>I grabbed an undercooked hotdog with chili and cheese piled on top of it, a bag of greasy chips, and a soda (gasp!) for 2$ on Connecticut Avenue. For 2 bones thats a killer deal. Most packages with that many calories usually cost you at least 3 or at least charge you sales tax. So I had my chilidog and went on my merry way. While I was adding in contacts into one of my supervisor's Outlook contacts (don't ask) I came across a funny name.   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Richard E. Wrinkle</span>-- I kid you not. I thought it was so funny that I sent an email to my uncle and he answered back with this:<blockquote>I had a job once where I saw thousands of names.  I topped the list with: <br /><br />Phok Yu, Martin Batcock, and ... drumroll please...<br /><br />Crystal Beaver.</blockquote>May God have mercy on those poor souls. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Help! I'm in debt!</span> Its okay, I've been in debt for a while and 4300$ will be going towards a new computer. I'm feeling a little uneasy about the purchase now however. Every Mac person I talk to is like "Dude, it's well worth it!" while other people are like "1200$ for a flippin' monitor? Jesus Christ- just go dual monitors, dude." I know the original plan was to give my sister the comp when she got to college but...ehhh....I could build her a computer for the price of one paycheck so...I dunno. <br /><br />All I know is that if I don't get into any fun with someone I know or don't know I'm going to go ballistic soon. I just haven't been having much fun lately and I know it sounds selfish but wtf everyone needs some joy every now and then. Every time I turn around I need to be calling some jackass who won't return my phone calls or a company who changes their number just about everytime I attempt to complain. I'm so sick of the fucking telephone already. There are a couple of technologies that I want to see put to rest before I die:</span><blockquote>1. Land Telephones- Because I hate dumbasses who call themselves tech support when they can't get a god damn line to work for 4 months.<br />2. Combustion Engines- So you're hanging onto a wheel that turns the tires that is right behind a huge, heavy piece of steel that is exploding at a *relatively* steady interval. <i>Exploding</i>. This kind of shit should have been taken care of in the 90's people.<br />3. Botox- Look people, your ugliness is Nature's way of trying to control the population of the human race. Don't fuck it up for everyone else just because you think you look silly. If you were pretty before and something happened to you thats a different story. No wait, I change my mind...never use Botox.<br />4. Weight loss drugs- THEY DON'T WORK. GET OVER IT. YOU <b>CAN'T</b> POLISH A TURD. So by sitting down all the time and popping pills all the time its going to screw up your body in many ways. In your fight to live longer you die sooner; that makes tons of sense, Stupid.<br />5. Filing Cabinets- hmm...a storage device that weights 500lbs when it's in full use and has an absolute maximum, requires constant attention to keep up to date, look dreadful, and takes up 95% of your already-too-small office. You <i>could</i> stick the piece of crap next to the window but chances are your filing skills suck and the ever-growing temple would block out the sunlight for you and 3 other offices.<br />6. Lithium Ion Batteries- because its been how decades since batteries first hit the shelves and we JUST PAY MORE AND MORE FOR THEM. Of all the technologies that should be declining in price with the demand of today it should be batteries. SO WHY THE &amp;$#@! AM I PAYING 8 DOLLARS FOR 8 BATTERIES?!<br />7. Soap Operas- quite possibly the worst device ever created by human hands. This is probably what will make me finally end my own life after spending my last 500$ on a cybernetic transplant when I'm 132 years old. So close to the years of Moses and yet because of crappy daytime television I will lose my patience and unplug my shitty Lithion Ion Battery pack.</blockquote>I'm a tired old man. Only 20 and I have 3 decades to bitch about. And I'm poor. Anybody want to buy a 32 harddrive RAID with hotswap SCSI drives? Controller included- and this bad boy has 4 power redundant power supplies. Hawt.<br />

          So I'm taking this Latin Dance Class right now in the summer. I find it rather funny that i'm one of only 3 guys in a class of 17 and the only one who seems to be actually interested in learning it and not just taking it for credits. But so far it seems to be going pretty well. I'll tell you one thing thuogh, i've can easily say i've never been more fluid in my entire life as far as movment goes cause they really break you in as far as moving your hips.. phew.. man they hurt like nothing else the first couple days. However once you get the rythme of things it turns out it's not that hard just requires some practice like anything else. So for all you guys out there ( and girls too!) looking to try something new my two cents is go take a dance course cause if nothign else it certainly will be something different from the norm. But yeah so i was just sitting here wondering just where exactly did this unspoken social stigma for guys and dancing come from? I was snooping around last night and found some interesting information which was talking about how back in the day dancing was seen as being unproductive and since men back then were all about productivity ( snicker..yeah right.) it was deemed "unmanly" to do such a thing...<br /> <br /> ...eh...i don't know about that but it was just a passing thought more then anything else so i'm not going to invest the time to delving deep into it.<br /> <br /> <br /> ..oh and i'm quickly finding out just how long a guy can last off of nothing but hummus, pita and bagels as his sole source of nourishment...<br /> <br /> <br /> ..stupid paychecks coming late.<br /><br />

          Michel Jackson is having more rug-rats.  A woman agrees to be inseminated with the Jackson-seed.  And as a result, is having quintuplets.  <br /><br />Why is he trying to reproduce so many children?  <br /><br /><blockquote>“Jackson later revealed in a television documentary that Prince Michael II had been born to a woman who was essentially a stranger to him. ‘I used a surrogate mother and my own sperm cells,’ he told British interviewer Martin Bashir. ‘She doesn't know me.’ “<br /><br /><i>+LOS ANGELES (Reuters)+</i></blockquote><br />Is this OKAY?<br />

          Ok so funny story for everyone.<br /> <br /> So I have a thing about candles..ehh..I like them. so i Have a bunch set all over my room so when I had a stressed out day or something I light the room with them only and relax to some music or a book or something right? so the other day I was blowing them out to get some sleep and I have these two candle holders with candles in them. Except that they've been lighted for a while and the wax is in liquid form. so I go to blow them out except on my initial blow they don't go out so using my amazing logic I just blow really hard to get them out...<br /> <br /> ..and end up with a face full of liquid wax.<br /> <br /> <br /> tottaly not a ninja moment. Had any of those?<br /> <br />

          Too much Jargon and Slang clouds true meaning. To prove this, I am writing this otherwise clear-cut post with a slew of crap that most people might not understand... you'll see what I mean, I think.<br /> <br /> Beelo, your dityhrambic delving into the domain of the Dionysian should be thought of as less a descent and more a divertissement in this devilishly Daedalian devoir that is Life.<br /> <br /> A -3 penalty to Wisdom only matters if you're a Cleric, and even then, that +3 bonus to Charisma should add to the effectiveness of your Charm Monster spells, such that nary a villain could resist! Besides, you're already better prepared for battle than I, as I am a lowly Kobold who rolls his hit dice on a d4, whose wicker-work armor barely offers -1 AC, and who's rusted dagger would be lucky to do just 1d4+1 damage to a size Small opponent, if only my THAC0 were high enough to land even a non-critical hit. As for your Vorpal sword, that satisfying Snicker-Snacker may seem sufficient for fighting Jabberwocks, but you'll be sorry you didn't wish for <span style="font-style: italic;">Blessed Gray Dragon Scale Mail +2</span> when you're staring down a Master Lich in Lower Gehennom.<br /> <br /> Recent trends, both local and national, of this jingle-jangle jingoism, everyone being all-too willing to turn anything into some kind of culture war are not PC, not Kosher, <span style="font-style: italic;">no bueno</span>.   It's like playing an E Natural in B Flat scale; it's like playing a Locrian mode over anything; it's like resolving a Major <span style="font-style: italic;">opus</span> on a diminished vii chord.  Can't we all just get along?<br /> <br /> I guess I'm done.  I don't even know what I'm talking about... but Cless, I know YOU were probably  entertained.
