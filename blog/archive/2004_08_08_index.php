     <font class="TallRed">Anti-Fun Drugs Aplenty<a name="109246537518887708">&nbsp;</a></font>
		<div class="blackjustified" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;border-top:3px solid #cccccc;border-bottom:1px solid #333333;border-left:1px solid #cccccc;border-right:1px solid #cccccc;">
          Well, what drugs do I have right now? Not much...<br /><br />The most interesting drugs I have are really anti-drugs. For example, I have a fuckload (that's a technical term) of anti-psychotics, strong enough to turn me from a semi-hallucinating paranoid maniac into an empty shell of a person.<br /><br />Antipsychotics, however, are very very VERY useful in one specific case: Bad trips.<br /><br />Suppose one of my friends was tripping on LSD, and suppose it went bad. Now, I've been there before, and trust me there is very little in this world worse than a bad acid trip. Enter anti-psychotics. Assuming they want the trip to end, under normal circumstances they're simply fucked over until several hours (physical time; percieved time for the tripper is probably going to be on the order of 12 to 48 hours) has passed. Antipsychotics will end their trip, and end it NOW.<br /><br />Got a bad trip? Snort yourself 5mg of olanzapine, and within 5 to 10 minutes, you will be down, and no amount of LSD is gonna get you back up for at least 36 hours. What use is olanzapine? It's a first-aid medicine for the psychonaught. It's a security blanket. Olanzapine is being able to know that if it gets bad, you can end it before it gets worse. Honestly I'm surprised you don't see antipsychotics on the black market.<br /><br />In addition to anti-psychotics, I also have a bunch of anti-depressants (Wellbutrin). Of course, wellbutrin isn't nearly as useful  as olanzapine to the psychonaught; All wellbutrin will do is forcibly regulate the serotonin release and reception processes in your brain. Wellbutrin will make ecstacy behave like little more than a sugar pill, but honestly I can't see why anybody would want to kill their ecstacy experience. I suppose one scenario is "Oh shit I'm rolling and my parents just got home...", but I don't think that that's all that likely.<br /><br />So, yeah, what is my anti-drug? My "anti-drug" is a combo of pharmaceuticals tailored to anti-fuck your mind. I take a steady dose of 500 to 600mg per day of seroquel, another antipsychotic I was switched to after olanzapine simply stopped working effectively on me, and I also take 150mg per day of wellbutrin. So, even if I wanted to do them, LSD, mushrooms, ecstacy, mescaline, and any other dopaminic or serotonergic (spelling? who knows...) drug will simply have no effect on me.<br /><br />My anti-drug, then, I suppose, is drugs that keep me forcibly sane. Hehe...<br /><br />Mind you, I've found several interesting ways of getting fucked up despite my medications, but those I will save for another post. Happy tripping, class, and don't forget that you can always contact DrRobin if things get messy. :D<br />

          I've said what I needed to get off my chest.  Why is it that now I feel like something has just pulled me lower?  It was the right thing to do....this I know.  She needed to hear me say it....and I should have done it long before now.  Oh well, its all over.  Now I just need to work on letting her back into my life.  Something, at the height of my anger, I swore I would never do.  "Its all about closure.  Chapter read.  Lesson learned.  I'm doing my damnedest to not look back...." That was my motto...something I was going to hold myself to.  But her apology changed everything.  There's just something about this girl that I can't say "no" to; something I fall for everytime.  <sigh>  And the problem with this all?  I enjoy her far too much.<br />

This is the first time citizens of Iraq have been given the chance to participate in quite sometime. And when they were allowed to in the past, they were murdered or maimed if they lost. Hats off to the players, and the Americans who made this possible! How fitting for this to happen in Athens, home of the first games. Will they go far? Probably not, but it is amazing what the human spirit can accomplish. Portugal ain't no joke, so who knows! (I know J, they aren't Brazil either, but not many are) What an incredible feeling this single victory has to be for them. Little more than a year ago they were living under tyranny! Wouldn't it just be a little nice to maybe see the new Iraqi flag waving over the medals podium for one or two events? :)<br /><br />P.S. This would definitely qualify as one of those things I said some time ago that we spoiled Americans take for granted!<br /><br />

          ... that way I wouldn't have had to start a new post just to say... that a huge part of why R. Lee Ermey was so convincing as a Drill Sergeant is that he WAS a Marine Corps Drill Sergeant in the Vietnam war era.  He served for a good chunk of time, won several medals, and retired as a Gunnery Sergeant (which is why he refers to himself as Gunny sometimes on his current History Channel show "Mail Call").  Here's a link to more specific info... <a href="http://www.rleeermey.com/about/php">The Sarge's Bio</a>.<br /><br />And Beelo, I'm no Booyah Initaiate/Trainee Footpad.  I'll own you like R. Lee Ermey would own a watermelon.  And then I'll burninate your thatch-roofed cottage.  I am the Booyah Baron and the Blat Autocrat.

          Great news, I don't want Shannon! In fact, I want the lack of her. She's shown herself to be selfish, lazy, and foolish. That's giving her the benefit of the doubt, otherwise I'd have to add manipulative. She continues to act more and more like she <span style="font-style: italic;">likes</span> me (I use italics to emphasize the romantic connotation of a normal word), while being less and less accessible. That might have bothered me, but now that I'm sensible I just laugh to myself.<br /><br />It all came together for me yesterday, in a weird moment. She said something about loving Almond Joy, and that brought back a memory of when I was just ending my Duckie phase. What I learned about my Andie (as opposed to Duckie), and how I realized what an idiot I'd been. The good news is that I figured this out about Shannon before being an idiot. Instead, I'm only ashamed of breaking down and getting interested in her. The one thing that kept my interest was a feeling that she was actually going to change for the better after getting rid of her ex. It all looked like it was about to come together when I left, and now there's no trace of it.<br /><br />That's where the laziness comes in, I'm convinced beyond a doubt that her bad qualities are caused by her being too lazy to correct herself. I told myself to give her a chance, that I shouldn't discount her because I was much smarter than her (or rather, that I am more intelligent in general). Thanks to well-meaning friends, I even had an idea in my head about opposites attracting. I see now that she's acid and I'm a reactive metal. Wow, that's more true than I meant it to be. She really is dangerously selfish, she admits to thinking of herself as the only person on the road when driving. How in the hell did I ever ride in a car with her without fearing for my life?! Oh yeah, I was too busy marveling at her eyes. It should've bothered me that I saw them so frequently while she was driving...<br /><br />

          I have taken that taste of freedom.  Now it has been taken away from me for 8 days.  I hate being without that wonderful taste.  I need my fixation of freedom.  No more nagging from parents.  No more of them telling me "the house is much better when you are gone". I heart has taken its last blow.  I do not need that pain anymore.  My creativity has fallen now that I have come home.  This nasty place has given me back the headaches that I have been w/o for over two months.  I'm sleepy and worn of this.<br /><br />Now I must go and do something productive to ignore the fact that I am back in this hell hole that is called NOVA.<br /><br /><br />My GOODNESS I miss the city.<br />

          Does anyone know who this man is? For everyone who likes Bush and doesn't exactly know why... look up this guy's party affiliation and what he <em>owns</em>.<br /><br /><strong>On another note...</strong> I just wanted to express my feelings a bit about who I am and who we are. I am, we are, Americans. I was, you are, getting fooled into thinking we have small government. I am becoming, you need to be, a political activist until November because there are a lot of weird things going on in the country and as an informed citizen I will do everything I can to show people that things are screwy on the Hill. Robert Murdock owns 3/4 of the world's media sources and he's an extreme Right-Wing politician. 3/4 of the <i>WORLD'S</i> media sources.<br /><br />Screw parties and sides.<br /><br />What is your straight up stance on these issues? Wouldn't you like to know...<blockquote>- truth in the media<br />- the truth about who we're fighting<br />- just how much the church is involved in the government right now<br />- how the economy is doing (screw the Fox filter)...how it's doing in [reality].<br />- where (or who) the tax breaks went to<br />- how many students won't be able to afford school<br />- how many students <b><i>WILL</i></b> resort to getting their education funds from joining the military.</blockquote>Just how many of us gets our opinions from the nightly news? I'm not trying to look cooky here people. Just open your eyes a bit. So John Kerry represents the 'big government' party? You're kidding right? Just rub the sleep out of your view and see how big our government is <strong>right</strong> <strong><u>now</u></strong>.<br />

          Okay, I am looking over some tab sites for guitar cuz I am lazy and don't feel like using my ear. I hit this one site and one of the top downloads is a metal band called Metalium!!! What the fuck is this bitin, pansy ass, un-original, fucking bullshit! They even have a member named Lars? Are you kidding me? I feel like Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket right about now screaming at Private Joker that he's the kind of faggot Marine who would fuck me in the ass and not even have the common courtesy to give me a reach around... Sorry if that offends anyone, it is one of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie. Kubrick's finest direction, Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio's characters were so convincing that Ermey is still the Sergeant to this day, and it took years for D'Onofrio to shed the typecast of private Pyle, even now his characters don't ever seem to be playing straight, it's kind of like the lights are on, the gates are down, but the train just ain't a comin.... Anyway, what kind of crap is this anyway? Metalium.... I think I'm gonna start a band and call them the Bottles, or King, or the Why, or Rage Against the Garden.... my bad, that last one has been done...sort of... you get the picture.... I for one think a bands name sets the tone. If this is where they are starting, what does that say about them creatively? Is there none on this planet with an original creative bone left in them?<br /><br />

          I'd just like to clarify that my previous post was not a direct retaliatory (or even preemptive) attack against anyone here. Just now I read what I wrote and I suppose the chronological placement of my comments might have made it seem like I was attacking somebody. (cless?) Let me make it clear that I have no negative feelings towards anyone on e3r, except for kobold, that little lesser booya initiate trainee footpad sheister.<br /><br />No; that was an overdue counterattack to all the people that have tried to sway me in one direction or another spiritually, threatening my passage to heaven, and having neither the tact nor courtesy to even consider a different perspective than their own. I will say it outright: I loathe these people. My bones flex under the fury that burns through me when somebody begins a sentence with "The bible says..."<br /><br />Religion is an ancient device to maintain order, when law enforcement wasn't as ubiquitous as it is in this day in age. Granted, police will <em>never</em> be sufficient, but neither will religion. Tell me <em>one</em> thing that absolutely every single person in the world agrees with. Precisely. It's pure, chemical nature to assimilate or annihilate sources of conflict, and cultures are no exception. NOTHING IS SAFE. Religions come and go. (polytheism? what?) Governments come and go. Worlds come and go.<br /><br />Only when we find our very existence, as a species, threatened by something greater (Think ID4) will all of these issues ever be solved, even if that solution is our destruction. Next topic please.<br /><br />

          Has anyone here played Doom 3 yet? I normally cannot stand most shooters as they are pretty much blow up everything in sight and are mindless. My preference for shooters is usually Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, Siphon Fliter etc.. When I tried the beta a few months back, I was very disappointed. Now the release version is here and this game is fucking incredible. Id has done a wonderful job of making sure this thing runs well on low end systems and high end systems. Currently I am running an AMD XP+ 2600 overclocked, Nvidia GeForce 5200 with 128mb overclocked in AGP 8X mode, 1gb of PC3200 ram, a Soundblaster Audigy 1, and an 80gb 7200 rpm ATA 133 HDD. Not a big calculator, but not an SGI machine either. The graphics and sound are phenominal! The shadowing and dynamic lighting really bring the game out, and they have exploited many new DX9 features such as visual rippling from heat sources among other things. I am running the game at 1024 res with everything turned on but the antialiasing. Even with the AA off, there is almost no tearing whatsoever. As good as this thing looks, I am half tempted to go get a GeFore 6800 so I can run it in Ultra Mode. I know some of you all just groaned and are screaming ATI at me as we speak, but if you go read the reviews, the Nvidia GPU is kicking the living shit out of the ATI GPU, and the Doom3 engine is looking poised to bump the Quake/Unreal engine for the next few years. Soundwise, it blows me away, ID has apparently gotten together with Creative and EMU and written special standards for EAX2 in the game. There is an unbelievable amount of ambience, reflections, and doppler effects. This game is simply the best thing I have seen come to market in some time. For anyone who complained about the 10 years it took to bring this one back, it was worth the wait. My only complaint with this game is the flashlight, you cannot have the flashlight and a weapon enabled at the same time. The effect of this makes the game harder which isn't so bad. The AI is great also, enemies never stand there and wait for you, if they hear or see your ass 100yds away, they come after you.<br /><br />Forgot to mention, there is a setting in the config file that will allow all characters to have independent shadows. I know your thinking games already do this, but enable it in this game and see what you have been missing. It reminds me of Toca Race Driver 2, where the sun doesn't just cast shadows, it literally reflects off of everything independently. Also, you find things like warped glass in here that also ripples and distorts as you walk by it.<br /><br />

          The real tragedy here is that so many have been pushed away from religion. It really does not bother me when politicians evoke religous beliefs in their ideas and opinions. This nation was founded as a Judeo-Christian Nation. Every relevant document, from the Declaration, to the Emancipation heavily mentions God. Unfortunately sometime in the early 80's, a bunch of these damned evengelists (and damned is the way I feel about them), got the idea that they could use God and the Word to build themselves an empire. We had Jim and Tammy Fae Baker collecting money in the name of God, later to the "shock" or in my opinion, the sheer stupidity of their followers, finding out that these people were spending "God's" money on cars, mansions, plastic surgery, and a number of other decadent endeavors. Then of course we had good ol Oral Roberts. Roberts told us that God wanted us to raise a million dollars for him, or the Hand of God itself was going to remove him from this Earth. I am amazed that his followers who should be so learned in scripture, absolutely failed to see the blasphemy in this man. His request in itself violated the Ten Commandments with it's coveting and vain nature. Well Mr. Roberts didn't quite get to a million, nor was he taken from our Earth for failing to. <br /><br />One of the other things that really drove a spike into people was the whole twisting of judgement by your fellow man and the Bible thumpers who practice it. I have heard people say the Bible forbids judging. This is absolutely false! What the Bible says is that we are supposed to judge. But, we are not supposed to embarass someone by judging in front of people. The idea is basically that if I see someone doing something wrong, I am supposed to take them to the side, bring it their attention, and then leave it alone! There is a story in the Bible about Noah. Noah had gotten drunk and passed out naked in his tent. His youngest son found him and brought the rest of his brothers to see. He told them, look at our father and his drunken nakedness. When Noah found out the next day, he was furious. Not because his son had judged him, but because he brought others to see. One of your responsibilities as a Christian is to spread the word, but once again, you are only supposed to lay it put and then leave the person to come to God themself. Another thing that has driven many away is the ideas of forgivness, or rather what they have been taught they need to do for forgivness. This is something that really has its roots in the old church, the Crusades, etc. I ask anyone here to correct me if I am wrong, but I do not remember anywhere in the Bible where I am told to confess my sins to a Priest, or for that matter, I do not remember reading anywhere that God has ordained any mortal here on Earth to be his middle man. <br /><br />To be quite honest, I am not sure where the ceation of the church is laid out. About the closest  I have seen is when God asks "gather my people". I went to the Cathedral once at about 2 am. I had never been there, and I wanted to see the architecture as the worlds cathedrals have some of the most incredible engineering I have ever seen. The flying buttresses in particular fascinate me. Well I was in there for about a half hour when I came across a security guard who promptly told me I was trespassing and needed to leave. My response to him was that I hadn't realized God hod hours of operation. To go back to the question of forgivness and what needs to be done to attain it, the answer is simply that there is NO requirement other than asking. When Christ was being crucified, there were two other men there with him. One of the thieves asked Christ for forgivness and Christ asked him if he believed in his father. The man said yes and Christ told him he would see him in the kingdom. What did he have to do to be granted this? Not a thing, it isn't like he could climb down and go help a leper. I would say that negates the Catholics idea of penance, wouldn't you? <br /><br />Premarital sex.. another tool used by the Government in the name of God called Catholicism. When you are married, the minister, reverend, priest, reads the vows from a piece of paper placed within his Bible, not from the Bible itself. Once again, if I am wrong tell me, but I do not remember seeing vows in there either. The Bible more or less says to love the one your with, so how does the church condemn, or even define premarital sex. In a nutshell, people are not idiots, and many of them see very clearly how the church is hipocritical, and controlling using fear. The church itself is responsible for pushing people away more than anything else. As we speak, they are continuing this. <br /><br />Now personally I am against Gay Marriage, a topic that was brought up earlier. But I seriously pose this question to ANY AND ALL Catholics here. Let me get this straight, the Church condemns homosexuality.... Oh yeah, unless of course it is a priest raping a little boy, then it somehow ok, it is a sin between them and God and God will take care of it. And I am supposed to have faith in the church for what reason? It is reasons like these and many others that have pushed people away from God, and I say again, that is the real tragedy, that is what makes my heart cry. That is why I think you find most people who turn from God do not turn Atheist as much as they turn Agnostic. We want to believe, we are just not sure what to believe in. I will also ask this question... How do you justify people that would scare you into believing in God? If I am God, I want people to love me because they love me, not because they fear me. Respect from fear is not respect, it is fear.<br /><br /><br />Quick note to Cless. I would partially disagree with the human nature thing. While greed and selfishness are traits that are inherent, kindness and humility are also. How many times have you heard of someone running into a fire, or jumping into a river, risking their life to save someone they have never met? This is one of those thing that we percieve because the bad people muddy the water so much it is hard to see the good people, or even trust them when you do.<br /><br />BEELO... not all of us are like that, my beliefs by no means support my ends. There are those of course that do manipulate their beliefs, and with them you are absolutely right on the money. I am reminded of Clinton a few years ago when a letter to Gennifer Flowers leaked out. In it he said how he had found in the Bible that adultery was acceptable, and oral sex was not sex.... Once again, anyone here tell me if I am wrong, but I simply do not recall that..<br /><br />Oh, I remember now, it was in the Book of Paul, in his letters to Penthouse...<br /><br />Dear Penthouse: I read your stone tablet every month, the fold out etchings are simply wonderful. Of course, I read the articles for the most part, your review last month of sandals and mir was very informative. Anyway, I always read your letters section, and I usually wonder about their truth as these stories never seem to happen to me, but then, just the other day, me and the big JC were sitting around rapping scripture, JC was talking about turning water into a 40, and getting the whole town stoned on one joint, we were also discussing the idea that there was a narc in our midst. I told JC that he should keep an eye on Judas, and he told me not to worry, it was under control. Anyway, as we were talking, this hot disciple came in and......... DOH! Two terms, we actually gave that piece of shit two terms!!!!<br /><br />Peace all, and find your spirituality where you find it. The cool thing about this is that as we look for the meaning of life, it is right under our noses in these questions. The meaning of life is simply...the search for the meaning of life... :-)<br /><i>edited by FSEVN</i>. Reason: Just a few more paragraphs needed. Otherwise, excellent post.<br />
