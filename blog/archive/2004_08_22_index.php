		<div class="blackjustified" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;border-top:3px solid #cccccc;border-bottom:1px solid #333333;border-left:1px solid #cccccc;border-right:1px solid #cccccc;">
          Okay, I will not pretend to call myself a programmer like some in the world do. It seems these days anyone who can write a line of code thinks they are a programmer. I have heard people who know basic HTML try to say they are prgrammers and I just about choke on my own spit hearing this. Years ago, I programmed in Basic and Pascal.. yuck! So I can say I have an understanding but am hardly knowledgable.<br /><br />With that said, the question to Java depends on one thing to me. As I understand it, and feel free to tell me if I am mistaken, there are two Java languages. There is Java that is a bonafide language, and then Java Script, which is as its name suggests, simple script. As I understand it, Java Script is used on the net for websites and such, and I tend to like what I have seen of it. It is versatile and can be used for everything from eye candy to useful web based applications. With the Java language, I have to say I cannot stand it. I worked for a company a few years ago that use a Java based application as its bread and butter application for interfacing with the various networks and databses the company used. It was the slowest, most bloated, archaic piece of shit I have ever laid my hands on. I spent the majority of my day hurrying up and waiting, and at times I wanted to throw my fucking monitor over the side of my cube. So my personal opinion on Java is it is crap. I completely understand that this may be due to lousy programmers, the above mentioned people that think they are programmers, so I say again, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG! :)<br /><br />This next part will only be of interest to true eggheads.. Hopefully they may get a laugh out of it.<br /><br />Hehehe, even worse for me today. The company I work for now, Washington Mutual, uses OS/2 Warp. And to make this worse, they run it in a Virtual PC container!!!!!! You should have seen my jaw drop when I started for my first day. When I got there, it was running straight on our PCs, the Virtual PC came later. This has helped, but you should have seen OS/2 running on a P4 with 512MB ram and an onboard Nvidia chipset. I swear it was as if OS/2 didn't have a clue what do do with the memory above 32MB. The HDD's were split into 5 partitions as OS/2 couldn't read above so many GB. Mart of the job me in closing loans entails the typing over and over, paragraphs of the same generic crap for Deeds of Trust, and Promissory Notes, there was no "notebook", Word, Excel, etc.. All typing all day long, no cut and paste. Shoot Me! I asked one of the techs why we used this OS and he told me it was for security issues, they were able to lock EVERYTHING down. One example was that the only things on the desktop that employees could use were LoanWorks(our central app), and Netscape. He explained to me that everything else was blocked. Really? I proceeded, in front of him to open Netscape, hash the c drive, c:/, navigate to the "win" directory, start up Win 3.1(which OS/2 is based on), install Word, Excel, and I even found a copy of Instant Messenger that ran on Win 3.1. My next problem was connecting AIM through the proxy. I looked in the cfg file for Netscape and found the URL Netscape uses to grap the proxy info. I opened word, wrote a link to the Proxy file, saved the doc as an html file, opened it in Netscape, did a right click, save target as, opened the saved proxy cfg file, input the server info into the AIM perferences, and that was that. The look on the techs face was priceless, it was as if his whole world had come crashing down. Now all of our PCs are WinXP with OS/2 running in the Virtual PC, which just leaves me to that much more havoc. One of the problems we have at work is that we are unable to email documents from LoanWorks to the title companies for borrowers to sign. It is very frustrating, we have to print the docs and then FedEX them, if anything was wrong, it required a reprint and a courier. I was in the proccess of writing a simple driver that would save the print spool to a PDF file that could be emailed, but alas we are all being laid off on Sep 30th, so I shitcanned that. Imagine the money that could be saved on FedEX and courier fees.... Hmm... we are the largest savings and loan company in the nation, and we can't even email.. I wonder why our company is losing money and our office is being shut down. MORONS! LOL Anyway, my egghead anecdote for the day.<br /><br />A side question for anyone here. Over time, I have had various pieces of crapware that has installed itself into my system. I have deleted it when I have found it, but now in my task manager, I find that I have 6 copies of SVCHOST.EXE, and a few other odd proccesses running, ALG.EXE, and MSSRV.EXE etc... These are Windows modules that were called on becuase of the crapware. Does anyone know how to track down what is causing these modules to start up at boot so that I can figure out which ones are truly being used by the system, and which ones are just eating memory? I know what some are thinking right now... Linux... cool cool, Linux is nice, I will give you no argument, but Linux is not good for me as I have certain applications that I need WinXP in order to run, and the apps I have used in Linux to do these same tasks are just as bloated as their WinXP counterparts.<br /><br />So there it is, another one of my all over the place useless posts. Hey J, I used paragraphs this time... Do I get a pat on my back for that? :)<br />

          Umm...so yeah...why is dform.org still working? I have no idea. It expired damn near 4 days ago and somehow it's still pointing here. No worries. I have a fresh layout in the works anyway with a brand new cover. Luck seems to be on my side at the moment, but not for long.<br /><br />No...god damnit...not long at all. *shakes fist in air*<br /><br />(I'm going to ignore the fact that my sister views this site.) So a couple nights ago I was pretty drunk. I drank almost a whole (small) bottle of vodka with my buddy J (girthy, long haired total-linux-g33kz0r orc-descendant D&D fan) where I found a cat meowing and looking just as lovable as can be (and what isn't when you're smashed). SO I take the cat and get in the car and Morg drives me back to our place where we then feed the cat, give it water, and decide that if she is there tommorrow afternoon we will take her to the SPCA.<br /><br />So the next DAY we can't find her but she strolls up right where we left her the night before. We give her food and water again and TRY to keep her in the house but our cat was not happy at all. We put her out and crossed our fingers for the next day.<br /><br />The next day, the cat can't be found. The day after that, same results. Then today, I get a call from Venus De Milo sayin that right around the area I picked up the cat some flyers for a missing cat has gone up. I look for the cat again today and cannot find the cat whose name turns out to be "Goose". Probably because of its giant shnoz.<br /><br />Cat looked jewish.<br /><br /><br />

          Preface, to those of you who aren't in-the-know:<br /><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/db3k/booyasquad.jpg">Booya Squad</a> is a development team that consists of Beelo, Cutty, and myself. What do we develop, you ask? All sorts of things, which shall be revealed in due time, but one of our main projects is under the codename "Degeneration."<br /><br />The only thing you need to know about Degeneration is that any programming, or coding, or whatever you kids are calling it these days, is schedule to be done in Java. The programmers aren't exACTly sure that they're going with Java, but it's ahead in the polls.<br /><br />The Question I ask now is this:  Is programming in Java uncool?  A recent /. article has brought to my attention that <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/08/24/1230245.shtml?tid=108">some people would say yes</a>. What do you guys think of this? If there's anything that Booya Squad is NOT, it's uncool. We are the 31337. Well, not me so much, but the rest of the team is pretty 1337. Anyway, should we reevaluate our language choice here?<br /><br />

          Hey people, Joe here.<br /><br />E3R is sorta in limbo at the moment because our domain, dform.org, expires today. Right now Comcast is being retarded and I won't have internet access until Wednesday. "Well you could go use the library's internet access" is what I'm sure a lot of you are saying. However, my roof fell on my 600$ couch and the whole living room was infested with black and green mold. My idiotic landlord is taking 3 weeks until he can get a roofer out to begin working on our place *no doubt* because he doesn't want to spend more money on a professional. I can't wait till I'm away from this guy. Nice guy to speak to but he's just an ass. There is also leaks in the master bedroom, with steams imprinted on the bricks of the wall. We first noticed them when we noticed piece of brick, in a fine dust form, on my dresser. I took my thumb to investigate the walls further and my thumb took off a huge flake of brick with little force. <br /><br />More or less, my apartment is in ruins.<span style="font-weight:bold;"> Anyway, pay attention.</span> I can either renew dform.org or get another domain instead that makes more sense. How about e3rd.com? ya know...e as in electronic and 3rd as in "third"? no? How about e-3rd.com? Better? Eh, I need some help here people. Comment on this post and tell me which you like better.<br /><br />Furthermore, I just found out that my bill for school is due on Thursday, the first day of classes and I won't find out my estimated loan total until Wednesday. Mind you, I still have to change one of my classes to German 101. I'd really like that. Anyhoo, I gotta head back to the lab. <br /><br />How much would you all be pissed if I changed this layout a bit? It's very heavy...taking a whopping 5 seconds to load on the library's T1-powered LAN. Send your comments on that too while you're at it, skags.<br /><br />That's right...I called you all 'skags'. <span style="font-style:italic;">Oldschool</span>.<br />

          I know what you mean Venus.  Lately, when I look in the mirror it's like I'm looking at someone else.  I don't mean to say that I don't recognize myself, I'm talking more about the act of looking.  I've always had this weird ability to see what someone's going to look like when they're older.  At least I assume it still works, I guessed right for my friends' transitions into teenagerdom.  I don't notice anything physical in particular, I read into what I see.  I imagine kind of an overlay, like adding an alpha channel to an image.  It's because of that dynamic that things seem wrong when it comes to myself.<br /><br />When I look at a mirror I read into the image and become lost in thought.  Then I snap out of it and take myself at face value, and realize that I'm 20 years old.  Young, yes, but beyond the age of excuses.  That person can't be me, can't be as I have been.  That person has to grow up and live.  He doesn't have the luxury to, say, write something like this.  That's what really bothers me, way more than the fact that I'm standing around looking in a mirror.  I have to change and I don't want to.  I don't fear change, and I'm not really hesitant or scared.  I like planning, I like thinking, I HATE doing.  I'm bound to fuck something up if I do it, I'm destined to at least be injured.  Not being to stand, walk, or do pretty much anything else stably will do that to you.  It makes you manipulate your own thinking, even though you know you're full of shit.  And that's what it comes down to when I look in the mirror, I see myself facing these things.  I see me looking back at me, and I don't see the truth.  Come to think of it, maybe I don't know how you feel Venus.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Now that I've written all this it feels like complete bullshit, but I'm posting it anyway since I must have written it for a reason.<br />
