          ... brought forward some misunderstanding. I didn't mean to discredit all of these newer bands. I don't like any of the musicians and bands nearly as much as these new groups coming out; however, my point was in order to be great you need to be timeless. If after 10 years or 20 years you fade away into the extremely rare radio request on the oldies station then you were good, but you weren't great. <br /><br />Music speaks to everyone. Every song out there means something to someone, but my interpretation of "greatest musicians ever" automatically makes me think of your beetles or bob marley and the wailers or even beetoven. I still think there has to be a certain noticable impact generated to seperate a musician from good and great. <br />

          Like up until today, I thoroughly enjoyed having the beloved <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/21/">badger song</a> stuck in my head until I went to the theater. While waiting in line for tickets, lo and behold, this group of shaggy-gotta-beat-this-game-and-its-sequel-before-i-shower-and/or-sleep types were in a circle, pumping fists intensely to their own ominous chant of badger badger badger badger badger... then with the utmost jubilance destroyed the song forever yelling MUSHROOM, MUSHROOM!!! It drew a few stares, to include my death stare, and that was the end of that. Call me shallow, but I want nothing to do with those guys. They should shower more. And stop ruining songs for me.<br /><br />-- Better than those guys.<br /><br />P.S. I'd also like to add that yes, that would be considered influential, good, classic, timeless music.<br />

          <b>In which Cless embarks on a foolish journey that nearly kills him</b><br /><br />Okay, so here's my story of stupidity for you all to laugh at. A few days ago I decided to go to a local demonstration of Apple's new pro lineup of video software—Final Cut Pro HD, Motion, DVD Studio Pro 3, and Shake 3.5. I was really excited about this, since I'd be going with my friend Anthony from JMU, a fellow SMAD major and DV junkie. He was supposed to come pick me up from work at 9AM, drive me to the Metro, we'd go to Arlington and check this place out, then go hang with a friend and have some lunch, then head back.<br /><br />Flash forward to Thursday morning. I'm sitting in my office at 9:00AM, having been there for a half hour, and Anthony hasn't called. I'm a little nervous, but wait until about 9:15. Still no call, so I go outside to wait. It's 9:22 or so now, and I'm afraid he isn't coming. So, I decide to hoof it from my office to the Vienna Metro station, because I REALLY want to go. Problem: I'm wearing a sweater and pants, because it's cold in my office (and always cold in movie theaters, which is where the demo was being held).<br /><br />I'm about a third of the way there and I'm already sweating nicely; it's very muggy and hot out. I'm not making good time, and suddenly the Metro station seems very far away. But I push through it. I get to the intersection of Lee Highway and Nutley, now soaked in sweat (and seemingly unable to sweat anymore). But the goal's just around the bend. It's pushing 10, so I'll be late already, but at least I'll get there.<br /><br />Then I get lost. I know, it seems ridiculous, but I took a wrong turn, got into a housing development and couldn't figure out where to go from there. By this point I'm definitely not actively sweating anymore, and my legs are quite tired. I decide to turn around and go to the nearest office building to try and get some directions. I get there, and ask a guy how to get there. He gives me some patently unhelpful directions and then leaves. I try to find the Metro again. 20 minutes later, I'm back at the same building, feeling faint, disoriented, and dizzy. My feet REALLY hurt at this point. I ask a lady outside for some help. She tells me to sit down and gives my dumb ass a bottle of water. This woman is, obviously, a saint.<br /><br />A commuter bus shows up and takes me to the Metro station, which is what I should've done in the first place. It's now 10:30. I've missed a half hour of the event, and will miss another 20 or so in transit. By the time I get there, it's 10 of 11. I'm already shaking my head in mild disgust, questioning my own sanity.<br /><br />Turns out they started a half hour late, so I'd only missed 20 minutes of introduction and Final Cut Pro (which I'm most familiar with). Found Anthony during an intermission. They skipped the Shake demo at the end due to lack of time, which caused me to kill everyone in the room and steal me a G5. Just kidding. But it did bother me a lot, since that's what I was most interested in. Looks like it's time to buy the training book w/ the 30-day-trial.<br /><br />And after all that, when Anthony and I compared timings, it seems I left my office JUST before he called, and left the parking lot JUST before he arrived. All this headache could've been avoided if I'd been that much more patient.<br /><br />So there you go; that's how I almost killed myself in the summer heat. Moral: if you're a geek, never go outside unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY and you're equipped for the environment. Otherwise, you'll die, or at least suffer exhaustion and a severe injury to your pride.<br />

          Cless, feel free to post now without fear of being a "front-page whore."<br /><br />So I think NothinGold here brings up an interesting topic about bands and musicians.  What do you base the qulaity of music on?  Its ability to "take the world by storm"?  Should the quality of someone's music be heavily based on its influence on future musicians?<br /><br />First, let's look at what takes the world by storm.  On the one hand, you've got the Beatles and Nirvana; on the other hand, Britney Spears and New Kids On the Block.  Sure, there was Beatlemania, but who didn't love MC Hammer?  Granted, the Hammer might not have been quite as huge as the Beatles, but I do believe he would qualify as "taking the world (or at least the US) by storm."  The point I'm trying to make with this is that lots of things become crazy popular, but most of them are what most people would consider to be, at least in retrospect, dumb things (see also: Tamagotchi, Macarena).<br /><br />Also, do all bands need to influence everyone to be good?  I would disagree there.  There are plenty of what I would consider to be awesome bands, some of which were just mentioned by Cless, which will not start a revolution, but can vastly influence individual people and stuff like that.  I mean, does it really matter if the majority of the populous doesn't recognize a band as being important because they've never heard of them?  The reality of tomorrow's music could be shaped by the Evanescence and Hoobastank of today, I wouldn't say that makes them great.  Like when you say that Shania Twain probably did a lot for country music, think about what she actually helped chang it into.  She most likely just helped push it into the mainstream; not by bringing the mainstream to country, either, but by conforming to the mainstream.  Whereas she may have done a lot for what country music is going to become, I wouldn't say that she did a lot of GOOD for it.<br /><br />And as far as today's scope of "revolutionary" goes, I think that we're really focusing on a very minute piece of what music is.  Our idea of revolutionary music might be something more along the lines of changing popular music from poppy rock to depressing rock, rather than jazz to rock, or something like that.  I mean, what about the evolution musical notation?  The advent of polyphony?  The invention of the piano?  Now THOSE were revolutionary.  Who knows, maybe the music of the future will be lyricless?<br /><br />After that schpeel, I hope some of you might re-evaluate your ideas of what makes music good, just kind of expand your views or something.  Not a sermon, just a thought.<br />

     <font class="TallRed">My opinion on the music thingy kinda<a name="108757798379842048">&nbsp;</a></font>
		<div class="blackjustified" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;border-top:3px solid #cccccc;border-bottom:1px solid #333333;border-left:1px solid #cccccc;border-right:1px solid #cccccc;">
          I don't think bands albums put out by the Beetles and Hendrix or even the Beach Boys and Johnny Cash are great because of just solely their music. They have been out for decades(over and people still talk about them. People are still obsessed with them. They have stood the test of time. <br /><br />40 to 50 years from now are people still going to be talking about bands like Modest Mouse or Death cab for cutie? Probably not. They aren't taking the world by storm and doing new and inventive things to the extent where they might revolutionize the entire music industry. They are decent bands, but they aren't even comparable to the greats yet and they have had a few albums to prove themselves. <br /><br />The only modern bands that I can think of off the top of my head that might be in this "great" category are probably Nirvana and Sublime, respectively. I guess Shania Twain and Garth Brookes have done a lot for country music. The Jackson Five isn't really modern anymore, but they got these poppy boy band types rolling and Michael Jackson definitely did some amazing things in the 70s-80s.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is great bands need to be really amazing in the sense that not only their music is good, but they can affect the music that comes after them and completely change the way people look at the genre and they HAVE to be remembered way down the line. My post is turning into a ramble so I'm gonna cut off now. <br />

          I actually think we're in agreement, TuuK, about the talent thing; maybe you just read me wrong. What you said about "clone" bands is exactly what I think is wrong with American music, which is what I was saying when I was talking about homogenization—everyone sounds the same. What I meant about new talent (and diverse talent) is that record companies NEED to start finding bands like that, not that they have been (because, quite obviously they haven't). People are tired of the dreck that's been out there for years now; record companies have to start finding bands that people want to pay for, bands that have real talent and originality. They also need to stop signing everyone who's moderately good, because there are a lot of duds out there for the few huge bands that bring in all the cash.<br /><br />Also, I take issue with your assertion that the last time that really great bands were found in a short period of time was the 60's. There's a lot of exciting stuff happening in the post-rock and indie scene right now: bands like Broken Social Scene, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur Rós, Modest Mouse, Death Cab For Cutie (who've both now hit the big time, relatively speaking), The Shins, Belle & Sebastian... There's a lot of neat new music coming out these days that's very different from the nu-metal vs. pop sameness of the late 90s. Yes, there were some really fantastic bands from the 60's, but let's not write off all the cool new artists.<br /><br />And to Kobold, I know that digital quality is quite good these days, but digital is just a means to an ends (as you pointed out). Yes, 24-bit, 192KHz is very high sampling, and indistinguishable from the original to today's listeners. I was just mentioning that the best technically produced album of all time was made in the 60's, before digital ever hit the scene. I'm not a real analog vs. digital Nazi. I won't break into your house and smash your CD player and replace it with a Linn Sondek LP12—I'd go broke very quickly—but I think there's a misperception by the general public that "digital = better" automatically, which is of course a fallacy. Excellent sound quality can be obtained by either.<br /><br />To be fair, there is some pretty impressive home studio gear available these days. Most people can afford at least some decent quality gear for a few thousand dollars. But I have yet to hear a home-produced album whose mixing and mastering can match up to studio work by professionals. It's just a different level. In fact, even though I like their music, I find it hard to listen to Death Cab For Cutie and Modest Mouse's earlier albums, which simply aren't as well-produced as their latest, major label offerings. I just wish that all the neat new bands had that opportunity the first time out, by demonstrating talent on demos and being adequately marketed by the labels.<br /><br />And now that that's out of the way, I have to wait for one of you bastards to post again so I can tell the incredibly ridiculous story of my own stupidity yesterday, so I won't look like a front-page whore.<br />
