          Note: This may be a condensed version, I don't feel like writing this out now but I might say it all to avoid finishing it later.<br /><br />Folks, I may well be psychic. I never believe in that kind of thing, but lately I've been too right too often. Two weeks ago, I went on my annual two week trip to Memphis to visit family. Just before I left I got the feeling that I was about to experience a repeat of a nasty turn of events from three years ago. In short, a girl I was really into went back to her ex-boyfriend (of many months) and decided to give him her virginity while she was at it, whilst I was away. When I got home, she announced this to me as though I was to be happy for her. I didn't think Shannon was going to go back to her ex, but I was sure I was about to go through mostly the same thing.<br /><br />The day after I arrived in Memphis, I called Shannon and made plans with her for August 6. One week later, I was horribly grief stricken with a feeling that Shannon had started dating another guy, and that this was going to cause her to forget all about our date (but not a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). It took me two days to get over that, during which I matured a lot and came to understand many important things about myself (Intelligence + Self-Awarness + I Ching = Maturing).<br /><br />I got back on Wednesday and called Shannon to announce my safe arrival, and to check in on our plans. I asked her if her plans had changed, or if she was still free Friday night (tonight). She didn't know what I was talking about, so I reminded her and again asked if she would be available. She replied, "I don't know, that depends on.....you're coming to work Friday, right? Talk to me about it then." Today at work all seemed very well, Shannon was extremely pleased to see me and approved of my haircut and new glasses (which, dare I say it, make me mildly attractive). Some hours later, we went on an extended series of business-related errands. This turned out to be some wonderful time with her, which I could go on and on about. However, at about the 3/4 mark, IT happened. I asked about tonight, and she said that *Male Name* wouldn't like it if she went out with me tonight. She said he was on her every second of every hour, and that he didn't want her going out with any other guys (I took this not to mean a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). She said this matter of factly, not a shred of disdain in her voice. I said, "Who cares?! It's not like you're dating." This ranks right up there with that scene from Young Frankenstein "Could be worse, could be raining." You guessed it, they ARE dating.<br /><br />I responded with unadulterated shock. She just laughed and said "Come on *My Name*, you knew that!" I rather pointedly told her that I didn't, and laid out exactly what I knew before I left (in short, that she had just left her ex). I was livid, but I only showed it in the rhythm of my speech. She just said that she and this guy were "talking" last week and now were passed that. By the way, *Male Name* is a mechanic at work (that we rarely see up front). The last time I heard "talking" used that way was 7 years ago, and that wasn't a happy day either. All the other times she mentions this guy have to do with his jealousy and control over her. I almost said "Silly me, I thought you had self resepect." I didn't, but I was more disappointed in her for what happened than I was angry. That time 7 years ago was the first in a 2 year string of my playing the role of Duckie from Pretty in Pink (though not that extreme). I didn't ask about him or talk about it for the rest of the trip, fearing that my disappointment was a warning that I was heading into Duckie territory.<br /><br />Later, while she was pumping gas, I had my annual summer epiphany and was completely fine. I even told her, I said, "Remember all that angst back there? Forget it, I'm fine now." She asked why, and that started a discussion of my strange annual enlightenments. I'd never talked about them with anyone before, and she was genuinely interested. After all the talk of my high standard for my own reasoning (which would require a very long post to explain) and such, she seemed to have a lot more respect for me. I didn't think she lacked respect for me before, but she looked at me like some kind of sage (as opposed to "My parents looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears." from A Christmas Story). However, the whole trip was a bit like a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>, in terms of conversation and signals exchanged. She made an effort to look me in the eye whenever possible, and I returned fire. She says I have "Mel Gibson eyes", and my new glasses accentuate them. Just as well, I think she has the most beautiful eyes humanly possible. I swear, she wants me more now that she's with him. I know how that sounds, but I'm dead serious.<br /><br />I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm staying out of it. I'd like to think that he's just her rebound guy. I don't care what she does with him (as opposed to three years ago when the girl's sexual escapades crushed me), I'd rather she go celibate after him than be her rebound guy. Emotionally I'm rabid that this kind of bullshit still goes on in my life, but cognitively I'm okay with it. I'm not worried or anything like that, and I'm decreasingly paying attention to my emotions on the matter. I'm going to sit back and watch what happens, only talking about it if she asks (and even then, of course, with some caution). Next week is my last week at work before I start school, unless I have to impede my buffer week before classes to get something finished. I hope she comes to her senses before I stop seeing her daily, I'd hate to get out of the loop with this going on. Of course, I'll keep contact with her, but I won't be in the thick of things anymore. Judging by how hard it was to make plans with her when we had roughly the same schedule (and I saw her everyday), it will be near impossible to see her once I get going at VCU. And that's supposing *Male Name* doesn't have anything to do with it.<br /><br /><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="font-size:100%;"><blockquote></blockquote></span><blockquote></blockquote></div><br /><br />

          E3R is a place to vent or it is a place to debate. I don't want to sound hypocritical but lets make sure we're not going over the deep end by combining the two. <br /><br />I don't mind religion, it really doesn't bug me until it's pushed down my throat or I see someone so involved that they have no common sense. So I cringe around zealots-- lets not all become one.<br />

          Fair warnings first, if you're easily offended or brimming with religious zeal then go ahead and skip this post. Religion is for those individuals too weak or otherwise unwilling/incapable of accepting life for face value. It's a support group for those who live in fear of death. It's an excuse for everything. It's a hypocrisy. It's whatever the fuck you want it to be to support your own personal ends. Do you really need that GOD to tell you what's wrong or right? How to live your life? To tell you to be good or else you'll rot in hell? I could go on and on and on about why I'm right and you're wrong, and I'm sure you could too. Rest assured neither of us are going to back down because of your infallible fear of uncertainty and my not-giving-a-fuck.<br /><br />Though, if this is the start of a long debate about religion then I'll see you in a few months e3r<br /><br />

          <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> The following post will be mostly stream-of-consciousness and not well thought out, and will be very religious (specifically Christian) in nature. If this bothers you, please read on. If it doesn't, please read on. FSEVN hit a lot of things in his post, many of which I want to respond to. As is often the case, I was initially ready to shrug it off and say "Well, most people don't want to hear my viewpoint, and these sorts of issues are very hard for me to think out and present in a nice essay." Then I realized that's not what this is about, and what I have to say about the multitude of issues raised is just as valid as anything else that can be said. I'm taking this opportunity to stand up and be heard, and hopefully produce some dialogue.<br /><br />The difficulty with any religion is that it is at odds with human nature. I believe this is right, because I find most of human nature repellant—an interest in oneself as the most important person is what leads to the evils we so commonly perpetrate against our fellow man. In that way we ARE weak. We are constantly impelled by our nature, which is to disregard others in our quest for self-fulfillment—we are slaves to it. Slaves to selfishness. Slaves to ourselves. Slaves to sin.<br /><br />Now we can argue until we're blue in the face about the likelihood of a God, invoke all kinds of religious musings, scientific theorems and ideas, philosophical questions, and more to "prove" or "disprove" this issue one way or another. Truth is though, the fact that every person seems to have a voice in the back of their head saying "Hey, you shouldn't do that" even when they DO points to there being a higher morality or law (regardless of where it comes from) than us. I choose to believe that's God, in the back of our heads reminding us how we should treat ourselves and others.<br /><br />Problem is that people have turned that voice, that impelling movement, into a dogmatic system of rules and regulations. Christianity isn't about a checklist of things to do spiritually that you move through and do. It's about a real living relationship with a higher force than yourself and allowing that relationship to change your life and the lives of people around you in a positive way. It's first and foremost about respecting and loving the fact that we are uniquely created individuals put on this planet for a purpose, for its betterment. Secondly its about improving ourselves, fighting against temptations that hurt us and others, and helping others do right.<br /><br />This is where things start to get complicated (and these days, controversial). What your Dad did probably seemed right to him, but there's a big difference between forcing a set of rules and regulations on people and loving and nurturing them to bring them up to do right. I believe I should hate sin, but love people first and foremost. I don't care if what you believe is morally repellant to me, you're still a person, you were still created for a purpose, and I need to respect that.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the Bible isn't irrelevant—truth is that, despite the differences in society's surface, the heart of people hasn't changed much in 2,000 years. We still struggle with the same things (jealousy, envy, greed, gluttony, complacency, hate, etc.), and search for meaning in a world that often seems meaningless. One of my favorite places to go on the web (even before I became a Christian) is <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/">Relevant</a>, because they show that even in a modern time that seems a lot different than the Biblical world, that book still has a lot to say about our condition as people and how we should <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4253">treat each other</a>. Witness this passage from an <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4237">article posted recently</a>:<br /><blockquote>The politics of God and the politics of mankind have never been the same. God does not endorse your political party. God is not some party’s spokesman, symbol or tool, and in no way does He serve as a platform for this planet’s political systems. Nevertheless, there are many Christians who believe putting God-professing lawmakers in political power is going to bring radical social change. They must have forgotten that this method has already been tried. It was called the Dark Ages.</blockquote><br /><br />People are always ready and willing to write off the Bible because it has been used to justify great evil in the past. But is this any different than Muslim extremists using passages from the Koran out of context to justify their violence against infidels? There will ALWAYS be a segment of a belief group that is so blinded by evil that they see it as good, and there will always be manipulators who twist the truth to get it around to what THEY want to say. That doesn't mean that the whole of religion is a lost cause—it merely means that people can be easily lost, which we knew anyway.<br /><br />People have debated God's place in our society ever since it was questioned (which is certainly longer ago than you might think). Bush makes nothing new come to light, it's just that his presidency has been surrounded by more controversy than a lot in recent years, and so the level of dialogue has reached a fever pitch. I don't agree with a lot of his policies, I think many of the things he's done have been foolish, but what I really regret is that his misguided sense of Christian justice has put such an incredibly sour taste in many people's mouths. People are ready to write me off for wearing a cross around my neck before they've even talked to me, assuming I'm like the fear-spewing public figures they've seen.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I've shrugged off politics in general. I believe that God has higher means of achieving his perfect plan than the U.S. government. He's eternal, and our government isn't. All I can do is live my life the best I know how, asking God to help forgive me when I wrong others and do them harm (and asking Him to help them forgive me), and try to show love to people around me. I can't do that by instituting public policy of one kind or another, or worrying about what my earthly government does.<br />

I wish you could trade in your parents for new ones. That way, if I went through with the process I would have come out completely different with different parents and hell, maybe I would have the ability to tan like most people. But no, I'm brazilian, american indian, and polish, and probably a little jewish. Bah, who cares. The point is that I am a very fucked up individual. I might seem okay on the outside, and if you asked me I'd tell you the same, but on the inside I am chaos. <br /><br />And I rightfully blame my god damned parents.<br /><br />Yuh see, my dad is a loser. He wasn't always a loser, no. Once, he was a winner. He had big muscles, full head of hair-- most of the chicks at his school thought he was the hottest thing since flaming <i>shit</i>. But my dad had one flaw: he was easily suseptable to influence. My grandfather, Edward "Ace" Burdick, pushed his ideological beliefs upon my father but never acted upon them. So my father met my mother, did the nasty, and viola here's a tiny FSEVN walkin around pissin on the carpet. When he met my mother he changed a bit, went against his parent's will and married a woman from the wild jungles of Brazil who couldn't read a line out of "Go Dog, Go!" even if there was a gun to her head. <br /><br />I was never really close to my father due to the military. We moved so often, sometimes he would move without us. One time, when my father was living in Connecticut and we were living in the second worst ghetto I have ever had the joy of living in, my dad hit some black ice up north and flipped his car. <br />Ever since that day, my life would never be the same.<br /><br />He became a religious zealot-juggernaut on crack. I know many of you don't believe this stuff but we weren't allowed to eat meat for years, we weren't allowed to watch TV for years-- I had missed out on every single good movie from the year 1995 to 2000. What I really lost was my father forever.<br /><br />He makes me hate religion. I respect everybody who has faith and it doesn't matter which flavor of faith you like to gnaw on but there is a part of me always on the defense. If any of you, doesn't matter if you're my girlfriend or who ever...I don't give a damn who you are but as soon as you make decisions that affect me BECAUSE of religion then not only are you forcing your religion onto my reality but you're also fueling my fire. No one will <b>EVER</b> tell me what to do because a book says so. If you're really so weak mentally to figure out what is right and wrong without a manual then I hope you have a lot of help from you God. Mercy from me you will not receive.<br /><br />The problem with today is that there are many things, many peoples' lives at stake due to politics, religion, and the lack of a difference between the two. "In God We Trust"? Bah, there is nothing to fear except faith itself. It is faith that is the reason for the Holy War that everyone is fighting in. It is faith that causes money to seep to and from the White House. It is faith that keeps us blind just enough to keep the powerful in charge. What is the difference between Democrat's rundown of Big Government and the reality of the Republican's Sheer Might? I see nothing. <br /><br />So my father is up to visit me yesterday. My dad, uncle and I go to see some monuments around DC and everything is fine. We begin (actually my Uncle started it, I generally have nothing to say to my Dad) talking about Politics and my dad went right wing. Thats fine, he has a right to go right wing. But then, as to back up Repubs, he quoted some bullshit out of the Bible. This happens all the time so I sat back as my uncle retorted with something scientific. What's funny is that this is happening all over America, this very thing. Bush calls himself the great "uniter" but its this kinda shit that is dividing the country. Currently, he takes credit for splitting up the country more than the US has ever seen ('cept the civil war). What's wrong with Republicans?? <br /><br />Just wait, I'll answer that question. Can I just say that I was a Republican before all of this? I'm only a newbie Democrat. You know what caused this and many switches just like mine? <b>President Bush</b>. How? THERE IS NO FUCKING DIVISION OF CHURCH AND STATE. WE ARE ALL A BUNCH OF FUCKING WAR MONGLIN' PUSSIES WHO HIDE BEHIND OUR RETARDED-ASS PRESIDENT WHO DOES THINGS UNDER 'GOD'. GOD DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AMERICA ANYMORE. <br /><br />So, my Dad, as crazy as the sonofabitch is, represents a scary portion of the American population. He goes to church, his <b>wife</b> (my mom) is cheating on him and he doesn't know it, his children have no emotional connection to him besides hate, and he plans on voting for Bush. <br /><br /><div hspace="5" align="left" style="margin:0px 5px 0px 3px;padding:3px;width:180px;float:right;background-color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #000000;"><b><font face="verdana" size="1"><img src="http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/15/samesex.marriage/story.senators.jpg" width="180"><br>This man wants to tell you how God thinks the Country should run. Every R-Representive was sent to us from Heaven. Good Lordy!</font></b></div>Church does not have anything to do with State. My father has a fear that once "the Protestants and Catholics gain enough control in the Government that America will fall" and then he goes and votes for the side that is allowing this to happen. This is not propaganda people, you don't have to listen to me, I am not trying to change you. This is a scream, oldschool E3R style. My father is an idiot and there are too many of these walking around the capital. I got off the metro today greeted by 3 police officers in armor holding an AK-47. Oh wait, yeah that information about terrorists? Umm, that was from BEFORE Sept 11th, 2001. THAT TERROR LEVEL IS LATE TWO YEARS. This shit just doesn't make any sense and people are still buying.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and if they do ask me to fight next year in the war (due to 49% of the enlisted not planning on enlisting again next year) I will go and fight with pride. Not pride for the reason, not pride for my President, but pride for myself and for my GOD <u>DAMNED</u> country. I will fight, I will kill the enemy, and, if I do perish, I will not die in vain.<br /><br />Because after all, all I was was just a poor minority anyway. I was made to die for my country. I just want to remind you that my 15 page essay still remains on the left- to assure you that my mind and imagination will be more of waste than my whole, dead body. I dare anyone to tell me that I don't deserve college as much as a white kid from the uptown. I dare anyone to tell me I can't FIGHT like you can. I will tear your argument LIMB FROM LIMB to prove my point. If I am pulled away from college to fight, if ONE more thing gets in my way of my goal I swear to your God I will not be happy at all. I have worked too hard, I have given up too much, to make it to this point and be dragged away. <br /><br />And yes, I did just find out about my mom cheating on my father. <br />
