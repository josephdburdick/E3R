          Note that I have not been fucked over myself (recently, anyways). In fact, I have neither time nor tolerance for romance. Partly, this is because antipsychotics do a pretty tough job on your sex drive, partly because I've failed enough that I simply see no point in trying.<br /><br />So here's the question: What's so hard about saying no to a guy?<br /><br />Here's the male perspective: Suppose I like you, and suppose that you don't like me. If that is the case, then for god's sake, TELL ME! I realize that you think it will hurt me. Yes, in fact, this is true. But it hurts a hell of a lot more when you lead me on. The longer you pretend, the more shit will be hitting the fan when the truth comes out.<br /><br />Why do you lead me on? Is it because you haven't decided on an answer yet? If this is the case, I don't have a problem, but then this is not leading me on either. Why do you say "maybe" when you already know you mean "no"?<br /><br />Comments enabled; I hope for some honest replies.<br />

          Note: This may be a condensed version, I don't feel like writing this out now but I might say it all to avoid finishing it later.<br /><br />Folks, I may well be psychic. I never believe in that kind of thing, but lately I've been too right too often. Two weeks ago, I went on my annual two week trip to Memphis to visit family. Just before I left I got the feeling that I was about to experience a repeat of a nasty turn of events from three years ago. In short, a girl I was really into went back to her ex-boyfriend (of many months) and decided to give him her virginity while she was at it, whilst I was away. When I got home, she announced this to me as though I was to be happy for her. I didn't think Shannon was going to go back to her ex, but I was sure I was about to go through mostly the same thing.<br /><br />The day after I arrived in Memphis, I called Shannon and made plans with her for August 6. One week later, I was horribly grief stricken with a feeling that Shannon had started dating another guy, and that this was going to cause her to forget all about our date (but not a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). It took me two days to get over that, during which I matured a lot and came to understand many important things about myself (Intelligence + Self-Awarness + I Ching = Maturing).<br /><br />I got back on Wednesday and called Shannon to announce my safe arrival, and to check in on our plans. I asked her if her plans had changed, or if she was still free Friday night (tonight). She didn't know what I was talking about, so I reminded her and again asked if she would be available. She replied, "I don't know, that depends on.....you're coming to work Friday, right? Talk to me about it then." Today at work all seemed very well, Shannon was extremely pleased to see me and approved of my haircut and new glasses (which, dare I say it, make me mildly attractive). Some hours later, we went on an extended series of business-related errands. This turned out to be some wonderful time with her, which I could go on and on about. However, at about the 3/4 mark, IT happened. I asked about tonight, and she said that *Male Name* wouldn't like it if she went out with me tonight. She said he was on her every second of every hour, and that he didn't want her going out with any other guys (I took this not to mean a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). She said this matter of factly, not a shred of disdain in her voice. I said, "Who cares?! It's not like you're dating." This ranks right up there with that scene from Young Frankenstein "Could be worse, could be raining." You guessed it, they ARE dating.<br /><br />I responded with unadulterated shock. She just laughed and said "Come on *My Name*, you knew that!" I rather pointedly told her that I didn't, and laid out exactly what I knew before I left (in short, that she had just left her ex). I was livid, but I only showed it in the rhythm of my speech. She just said that she and this guy were "talking" last week and now were passed that. By the way, *Male Name* is a mechanic at work (that we rarely see up front). The last time I heard "talking" used that way was 7 years ago, and that wasn't a happy day either. All the other times she mentions this guy have to do with his jealousy and control over her. I almost said "Silly me, I thought you had self resepect." I didn't, but I was more disappointed in her for what happened than I was angry. That time 7 years ago was the first in a 2 year string of my playing the role of Duckie from Pretty in Pink (though not that extreme). I didn't ask about him or talk about it for the rest of the trip, fearing that my disappointment was a warning that I was heading into Duckie territory.<br /><br />Later, while she was pumping gas, I had my annual summer epiphany and was completely fine. I even told her, I said, "Remember all that angst back there? Forget it, I'm fine now." She asked why, and that started a discussion of my strange annual enlightenments. I'd never talked about them with anyone before, and she was genuinely interested. After all the talk of my high standard for my own reasoning (which would require a very long post to explain) and such, she seemed to have a lot more respect for me. I didn't think she lacked respect for me before, but she looked at me like some kind of sage (as opposed to "My parents looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears." from A Christmas Story). However, the whole trip was a bit like a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>, in terms of conversation and signals exchanged. She made an effort to look me in the eye whenever possible, and I returned fire. She says I have "Mel Gibson eyes", and my new glasses accentuate them. Just as well, I think she has the most beautiful eyes humanly possible. I swear, she wants me more now that she's with him. I know how that sounds, but I'm dead serious.<br /><br />I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm staying out of it. I'd like to think that he's just her rebound guy. I don't care what she does with him (as opposed to three years ago when the girl's sexual escapades crushed me), I'd rather she go celibate after him than be her rebound guy. Emotionally I'm rabid that this kind of bullshit still goes on in my life, but cognitively I'm okay with it. I'm not worried or anything like that, and I'm decreasingly paying attention to my emotions on the matter. I'm going to sit back and watch what happens, only talking about it if she asks (and even then, of course, with some caution). Next week is my last week at work before I start school, unless I have to impede my buffer week before classes to get something finished. I hope she comes to her senses before I stop seeing her daily, I'd hate to get out of the loop with this going on. Of course, I'll keep contact with her, but I won't be in the thick of things anymore. Judging by how hard it was to make plans with her when we had roughly the same schedule (and I saw her everyday), it will be near impossible to see her once I get going at VCU. And that's supposing *Male Name* doesn't have anything to do with it.<br /><br /><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="font-size:100%;"><blockquote></blockquote></span><blockquote></blockquote></div><br /><br />

          E3R is a place to vent or it is a place to debate. I don't want to sound hypocritical but lets make sure we're not going over the deep end by combining the two. <br /><br />I don't mind religion, it really doesn't bug me until it's pushed down my throat or I see someone so involved that they have no common sense. So I cringe around zealots-- lets not all become one.<br />

          Fair warnings first, if you're easily offended or brimming with religious zeal then go ahead and skip this post. Religion is for those individuals too weak or otherwise unwilling/incapable of accepting life for face value. It's a support group for those who live in fear of death. It's an excuse for everything. It's a hypocrisy. It's whatever the fuck you want it to be to support your own personal ends. Do you really need that GOD to tell you what's wrong or right? How to live your life? To tell you to be good or else you'll rot in hell? I could go on and on and on about why I'm right and you're wrong, and I'm sure you could too. Rest assured neither of us are going to back down because of your infallible fear of uncertainty and my not-giving-a-fuck.<br /><br />Though, if this is the start of a long debate about religion then I'll see you in a few months e3r<br /><br />

          <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> The following post will be mostly stream-of-consciousness and not well thought out, and will be very religious (specifically Christian) in nature. If this bothers you, please read on. If it doesn't, please read on. FSEVN hit a lot of things in his post, many of which I want to respond to. As is often the case, I was initially ready to shrug it off and say "Well, most people don't want to hear my viewpoint, and these sorts of issues are very hard for me to think out and present in a nice essay." Then I realized that's not what this is about, and what I have to say about the multitude of issues raised is just as valid as anything else that can be said. I'm taking this opportunity to stand up and be heard, and hopefully produce some dialogue.<br /><br />The difficulty with any religion is that it is at odds with human nature. I believe this is right, because I find most of human nature repellant—an interest in oneself as the most important person is what leads to the evils we so commonly perpetrate against our fellow man. In that way we ARE weak. We are constantly impelled by our nature, which is to disregard others in our quest for self-fulfillment—we are slaves to it. Slaves to selfishness. Slaves to ourselves. Slaves to sin.<br /><br />Now we can argue until we're blue in the face about the likelihood of a God, invoke all kinds of religious musings, scientific theorems and ideas, philosophical questions, and more to "prove" or "disprove" this issue one way or another. Truth is though, the fact that every person seems to have a voice in the back of their head saying "Hey, you shouldn't do that" even when they DO points to there being a higher morality or law (regardless of where it comes from) than us. I choose to believe that's God, in the back of our heads reminding us how we should treat ourselves and others.<br /><br />Problem is that people have turned that voice, that impelling movement, into a dogmatic system of rules and regulations. Christianity isn't about a checklist of things to do spiritually that you move through and do. It's about a real living relationship with a higher force than yourself and allowing that relationship to change your life and the lives of people around you in a positive way. It's first and foremost about respecting and loving the fact that we are uniquely created individuals put on this planet for a purpose, for its betterment. Secondly its about improving ourselves, fighting against temptations that hurt us and others, and helping others do right.<br /><br />This is where things start to get complicated (and these days, controversial). What your Dad did probably seemed right to him, but there's a big difference between forcing a set of rules and regulations on people and loving and nurturing them to bring them up to do right. I believe I should hate sin, but love people first and foremost. I don't care if what you believe is morally repellant to me, you're still a person, you were still created for a purpose, and I need to respect that.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the Bible isn't irrelevant—truth is that, despite the differences in society's surface, the heart of people hasn't changed much in 2,000 years. We still struggle with the same things (jealousy, envy, greed, gluttony, complacency, hate, etc.), and search for meaning in a world that often seems meaningless. One of my favorite places to go on the web (even before I became a Christian) is <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/">Relevant</a>, because they show that even in a modern time that seems a lot different than the Biblical world, that book still has a lot to say about our condition as people and how we should <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4253">treat each other</a>. Witness this passage from an <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4237">article posted recently</a>:<br /><blockquote>The politics of God and the politics of mankind have never been the same. God does not endorse your political party. God is not some party’s spokesman, symbol or tool, and in no way does He serve as a platform for this planet’s political systems. Nevertheless, there are many Christians who believe putting God-professing lawmakers in political power is going to bring radical social change. They must have forgotten that this method has already been tried. It was called the Dark Ages.</blockquote><br /><br />People are always ready and willing to write off the Bible because it has been used to justify great evil in the past. But is this any different than Muslim extremists using passages from the Koran out of context to justify their violence against infidels? There will ALWAYS be a segment of a belief group that is so blinded by evil that they see it as good, and there will always be manipulators who twist the truth to get it around to what THEY want to say. That doesn't mean that the whole of religion is a lost cause—it merely means that people can be easily lost, which we knew anyway.<br /><br />People have debated God's place in our society ever since it was questioned (which is certainly longer ago than you might think). Bush makes nothing new come to light, it's just that his presidency has been surrounded by more controversy than a lot in recent years, and so the level of dialogue has reached a fever pitch. I don't agree with a lot of his policies, I think many of the things he's done have been foolish, but what I really regret is that his misguided sense of Christian justice has put such an incredibly sour taste in many people's mouths. People are ready to write me off for wearing a cross around my neck before they've even talked to me, assuming I'm like the fear-spewing public figures they've seen.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I've shrugged off politics in general. I believe that God has higher means of achieving his perfect plan than the U.S. government. He's eternal, and our government isn't. All I can do is live my life the best I know how, asking God to help forgive me when I wrong others and do them harm (and asking Him to help them forgive me), and try to show love to people around me. I can't do that by instituting public policy of one kind or another, or worrying about what my earthly government does.<br />

          <img src="http://www.vicalecorporation.com/images/HB0041_42_sm.jpg" align="right" style="border:1px solid #000000;" width="100" hspace="5">ENTER THE RANT. I wish you could trade in your parents for new ones. That way, if I went through with the process I would have come out completely different with different parents and hell, maybe I would have the ability to tan like most people. But no, I'm brazilian, american indian, and polish, and probably a little jewish. Bah, who cares. The point is that I am a very fucked up individual. I might seem okay on the outside, and if you asked me I'd tell you the same, but on the inside I am chaos. <br /><br />And I rightfully blame my god damned parents.<br /><br />Yuh see, my dad is a loser. He wasn't always a loser, no. Once, he was a winner. He had big muscles, full head of hair-- most of the chicks at his school thought he was the hottest thing since flaming <i>shit</i>. But my dad had one flaw: he was easily suseptable to influence. My grandfather, Edward "Ace" Burdick, pushed his ideological beliefs upon my father but never acted upon them. So my father met my mother, did the nasty, and viola here's a tiny FSEVN walkin around pissin on the carpet. When he met my mother he changed a bit, went against his parent's will and married a woman from the wild jungles of Brazil who couldn't read a line out of "Go Dog, Go!" even if there was a gun to her head. <br /><br />I was never really close to my father due to the military. We moved so often, sometimes he would move without us. One time, when my father was living in Connecticut and we were living in the second worst ghetto I have ever had the joy of living in, my dad hit some black ice up north and flipped his car. <br />Ever since that day, my life would never be the same.<br /><br />He became a religious zealot-juggernaut on crack. I know many of you don't believe this stuff but we weren't allowed to eat meat for years, we weren't allowed to watch TV for years-- I had missed out on every single good movie from the year 1995 to 2000. What I really lost was my father forever.<br /><br />He makes me hate religion. I respect everybody who has faith and it doesn't matter which flavor of faith you like to gnaw on but there is a part of me always on the defense. If any of you, doesn't matter if you're my girlfriend or who ever...I don't give a damn who you are but as soon as you make decisions that affect me BECAUSE of religion then not only are you forcing your religion onto my reality but you're also fueling my fire. No one will <b>EVER</b> tell me what to do because a book says so. If you're really so weak mentally to figure out what is right and wrong without a manual then I hope you have a lot of help from you God. Mercy from me you will not receive.<br /><br />The problem with today is that there are many things, many peoples' lives at stake due to politics, religion, and the lack of a difference between the two. "In God We Trust"? Bah, there is nothing to fear except faith itself. It is faith that is the reason for the Holy War that everyone is fighting in. It is faith that causes money to seep to and from the White House. It is faith that keeps us blind just enough to keep the powerful in charge. What is the difference between Democrat's rundown of Big Government and the reality of the Republican's Sheer Might? I see nothing. <br /><br />So my father is up to visit me yesterday. My dad, uncle and I go to see some monuments around DC and everything is fine. We begin (actually my Uncle started it, I generally have nothing to say to my Dad) talking about Politics and my dad went right wing. Thats fine, he has a right to go right wing. But then, as to back up Repubs, he quoted some bullshit out of the Bible. This happens all the time so I sat back as my uncle retorted with something scientific. What's funny is that this is happening all over America, this very thing. Bush calls himself the great "uniter" but its this kinda shit that is dividing the country. Currently, he takes credit for splitting up the country more than the US has ever seen ('cept the civil war). What's wrong with Republicans?? <br /><br />Just wait, I'll answer that question. Can I just say that I was a Republican before all of this? I'm only a newbie Democrat. You know what caused this and many switches just like mine? <b>President Bush</b>. How? THERE IS NO FUCKING DIVISION OF CHURCH AND STATE. WE ARE ALL A BUNCH OF FUCKING WAR MONGLIN' PUSSIES WHO HIDE BEHIND OUR RETARDED-ASS PRESIDENT WHO DOES THINGS UNDER 'GOD'. GOD DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AMERICA ANYMORE. <br /><br />So, my Dad, as crazy as the sonofabitch is, represents a scary portion of the American population. He goes to church, his <b>wife</b> (my mom) is cheating on him and he doesn't know it, his children have no emotional connection to him besides hate, and he plans on voting for Bush. <br /><br /><div hspace="5" align="left" style="margin:0px 5px 0px 3px;padding:3px;width:180px;float:right;background-color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #000000;"><b><font face="verdana" size="1"><img src="http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/15/samesex.marriage/story.senators.jpg" width="180"><br>This man wants to tell you how God thinks the Country should run. Every R-Representive was sent to us from Heaven. Good Lordy!</font></b></div>Church does not have anything to do with State. My father has a fear that once "the Protestants and Catholics gain enough control in the Government that America will fall" and then he goes and votes for the side that is allowing this to happen. This is not propaganda people, you don't have to listen to me, I am not trying to change you. This is a scream, oldschool E3R style. My father is an idiot and there are too many of these walking around the capital. I got off the metro today greeted by 3 police officers in armor holding an AK-47. Oh wait, yeah that information about terrorists? Umm, that was from BEFORE Sept 11th, 2001. THAT TERROR LEVEL IS LATE TWO YEARS. This shit just doesn't make any sense and people are still buying.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and if they do ask me to fight next year in the war (due to 49% of the enlisted not planning on enlisting again next year) I will go and fight with pride. Not pride for the reason, not pride for my President, but pride for myself and for my GOD <u>DAMNED</u> country. I will fight, I will kill the enemy, and, if I do perish, I will not die in vain.<br /><br />Because after all, all I was was just a poor minority anyway. I was made to die for my country. I just want to remind you that my 15 page essay still remains on the left- to assure you that my mind and imagination will be more of waste than my whole, dead body. I dare anyone to tell me that I don't deserve college as much as a white kid from the uptown. I dare anyone to tell me I can't FIGHT like you can. I will tear your argument LIMB FROM LIMB to prove my point. If I am pulled away from college to fight, if ONE more thing gets in my way of my goal I swear to your God I will not be happy at all. I have worked too hard, I have given up too much, to make it to this point and be dragged away. <br /><br />And yes, I did just find out about my mom cheating on my father. <br />

          What is it about Bob? I have been having the most fucked up week, nonstop stress everywhere I turn. So I get into work today, I have launchcast playing, and Bob comes on.... What is it about this music that soothes my soul. I swear, I can be in the worst fucking mood imaginable, and it just goes away. You just can't be upset and listen to Reggae, even when the song makes you sadder, it is more like a cleansing sadness, kind like crying it out if that makes any sense. Of all the music that came out in the 20th Century, Time magazine voted Bob Marley Exodus as the album of the century and I think they really are onto something. No matter what you think of the music, you have to admit one thing, it is powerful. I have said before, these three guys in a slum in Trenchtown Jamaica, what amounts to a speck of dirt in the ocean, bascially invent this new genre of music and end up turning the world on its ear. I wonder if they would have ever thought their music would have such far reaching implications. From Clapton remaking I shot the Sheriff, to the Police, UB40, Madness and the Clash in England during the 70's and 80's, and on into the 90's with Sublime, No Doubt, the Ziggins, and of course 311. I wonder what Bob Marley would have said in the early 60's if someone had told him a bunch of lily ass white boys in a basement in OMAHA NEBRASKA of all places, would dig his sound and help launch the third wave of reggae. If anyone has ever seen Marley performing, on video of course, it is amazing, to say it makes me jealous would be a huge understatement. Some artist simply have a connection with what they are doing that gives them an almost deity kind of status. It is like watcing a Shaman performing rituals. Hendrix, Marley, Morrison, etc.. you get the feeling watching them that if they were in a room by themselves playing for the walls, that they would be just as intense. Anyway, I am in a great mood today and wanted to share.. LOL  I also found out this morning that Jimmy Cliff is going to be at the State Theater next Wed.. So of course it will be me and as many Red Stripes as I can pour down my throat. Hehehehe as I wrap this up, Toots and the Maytals are playing... 54-46 Thats My Number... Yes Sublime remade it, 75% of Sublime's catalog are remakes.<br /><br />Oh, and the growth of that genre from absolute obscurity, happened long before there was an internet and many other widely available forms of mass communication.<br /><br />

          So, it occurs to me that a may have a slight internet addiction. It's too easy to just get on Slashdot or Wikipedia and just keep clicking more and more links... it never ends! It's kind of cool, in a way, because I'm learning a lot of things; then again, I haven't been going outside as much as I probably should be. Now I know how to classify a star by its color or tell a sparrow from a warbler, but I haven't really looked at either since I learned this stuff. I've kind of been letting everything else suffer a little... I'm never very good with the whole concept of "balance", I suppose. It's at least good that I get addicted to the internet and video games instead of drugs or alcohol, but in some respects it's kind of the same. At least it's making me better at crossword puzzles.<br /><br />What IS cool though is that I'm playing a rock show/festival in Winchester on the 13th of this month with a band called Divider. Fans of Exploding Boy might know them better as "the band formerly known as One Day Forever", as Exploding Boy played a few shows with them back in the day. They're very good musicians and awesome guys, and everyone should come out and see the show. What sucks is that I missed band practice today, after being zonked into unconsciousness by stupid allergy medicine. I'm just going to have to practice real hard this week... their bass player is real good anyway, so I have some sizeable shoes to fill.<br /><br />I've been listening to the Decemberists a lot lately, and I highly recommend them to everyone. They're one of those bands that are incredible and nobody really knows about them (see also: Red House Painters). Their vocalist always reminds me of Zach, from Old Hat, and that's always a plus.<br /><br />In other news, I might just be going away to the old Radford University in the fall. It wasn't my first choice, but it's in a beautiful area, and it's supposed to have a better music program than Tech. What sucks is that some of my credits won't transfer until I finish my Associates degree... which means finishing my three final and most despicable classes: Health/PE, Intro to Speech, and Orientation. Yes, they're all first semester classes that I've put off until now. Dammit.<br /><br />Alright, I'm off to a small weeknight party that will surely turn into the kind of party where the girls get mad because the guys are playing Halo instead of talking to them. Woohoo! Arrghblingblingbling. Sorry.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/jul2004/n07272004_2004072705.html">The Soldiers of the Future (link borrowed from Slashdot)</a><br /><br />

     <font class="TallRed">cars, falls, and consumerism (oh and self-improvement masturbation)<a name="109161352617789593">&nbsp;</a></font>
		<div class="blackjustified" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;border-top:3px solid #cccccc;border-bottom:1px solid #333333;border-left:1px solid #cccccc;border-right:1px solid #cccccc;">
          Of cars... well I've made it a point to figure out the enjoyment that people derive from archetypal hobbies and interests of masculine origin. A few weeks ago I discovered the joy of fishing, and most recently I discovered that of cars. Of course, recently acquiring a nice shiny toy of a caracas red 3000gt will stimulate these kinds of things, but I thought I'd let it be known. I couldn't sleep last night so I grabbed my keys and sat in my car in the parking lot of the barracks, wishing I could just be flying down the road with no destination nor origin to drive back to. (and not have to worry about gas--when will they invent everlasting fusion cells??!) True, there's a certain sense of peace that bringin it back to our natural roots (ie fishing) lends, but there's also another sense of peace within the cockpit of a man-made monster. It's as if for a few moments of my day I'm allowed to be one with my car--Spinning limbs of rubber grabbing and clawing towards the next moment; rumbling breaths and a fixed, angry demeanor staring down whatever is in my way: Outlets for the facets of my personality that have no place in my personal nor professional life...<br /><br />Of falls...no, not like, water falls, more like, falling off an aircraft and hairline fracturing my shin bones. Whatever those are called. But they hurt. Not enough to be broken, just hairline fractured. It's like a deep throbbing pain from inside my bones that I know is NOT supposed to be there. Hope it heals. I'm a survivor. I know it'll heal.<br /><br />And lastly, of consumerism... I used to pride myself on the fact that money was always the last thing on my mind. I'd always tip waaaay more than I ought to, with no reason other than the waitress might have had a nice smile. (I usually forget by the time it's tip-leavin' time) Whenever I'd be rung up and notice a change box sitting on the counter--even if the sale came out to $4.01--every last bit of change would end up in there. I wouldn't even take the damn mint. And I don't think I've ever been to a movie w/ a girl w/o paying for her, FRIEND OR MORE YOU'RE NOT PAYING DAMMIT. But lately, it's all been about the car. Granted, I still do these things, but now I think twice about them. I've heard of this thing called prudence, but it's such a shame to have to apply it to something so.......MONEY! CA$H MONEY!!! ARGHHHBLINGBLINGBLINGBLING<br /><br />But even more lastly, is self-improvement masturbation. I don't even agree with the statement that self-improvement is masturbation, (I think that's a fight club quote, which in itself is probably quoted from elsewhere.. so sue me i don't do my research) but if that's the general consensus then by all means call me a greater kitten-killen demon. I havent set foot in a gym in about 4 months, putting it off and keeping up w/ the upkeep in less direct, unintentional ways (ie falling off aircraft) But I need to start. I slobbed it all the way through summer but winter's my more favorite season anyway. (next to super-winter, then summer, and lastly super-summer, because that's how it is here...no nice seasons...just the shitty ones and extreme versions of them) I guess I should also start taking some actual college classes. I can fake the funk all I want but I still feel guilty whenever I put "some college" for my level of education on various registration questionnaires (does IB count? bahahhahaa) But I digress...<br /><br />see that's what you get. you complain that it's too quiet and you have turds like me post garbage. ELLIPSIS...FILLED...GARBAGE! The lazy man's device to keep a piece flowing...BOOYA<br /><br />

          Things seem rather quiet here lately.  Allow me to interrupt the silence with a few tastelessly decorated quacks myself.<br /><br />These are the last weeks of summer for me, and ironically they feel exactly like the first.  No more obligations.  Work: over.  Vacation:  done.  Settlement:  very damn near to being behind me for good. <br /><br />So i wake up earlier than normal,  a result of the jet lag that still lingers even a week after hitting US soil.  Probably for the best anyway, i sleep like a vampire, practically.  However the obstacle i face each day is how to make my day as constructive as possible.  The thought of being absolutely idle makes my stomach turn.  There are three defining points to my day:  the starting point, where i force myself out of bed and into the shower,  the climax point, where i feel the neccessity to get out and venture into the mad social life that beacons on a day to day basis, and the final point, that point of falling action where i drop my body into the comfort of my bed and let sleep whisk me away.   The interval between points one and two is where i find myself looking for things to keep myself busy, always.  So i distract myself with movies (something i find far more constructive than stalenesss of television), guitar, and books.  And i avoid writing; something i enjoy doing, but can't find myself doing unless i force myself to.  Is this how it works?  I'm willing to bet all good writers can hardly pry themselves away from the typewriter.  Maybe i need to get out more.  And yet i just toured half of Italy for God's sake.  If the waters of Venice can't draw words out of me, what will?  Even in writing this utterly vain paragraph i find myself struggling.  And why should i?  This is only just another daily distraction.  <br /><br />And a total break from face character, at that. <br /><br />Adios<br />

          finally finished moving all my things into the new apartment yesterday. phew that took a while. The place is ok. certainly a bit of a fixer but I think it has promise. Unfortunatly the guys before it didn't take the best of care so when I showed the place to my mom she freaked out and started ranting but I kinda tuned her out after the fifth ramble of " this place is so dirty..blahblahblah..bio hazard..blabhlahblah..need hazmat suits to blah blah blah." However the only real thing I thought was dirty was the tube..phew man it had so much mold , mildew , soap scum that it all became an actual layer in the tub you could scrap off. Ew. Right well I most certainly hit that up with some bathroom cleaner and did a decent job of cleanign it up a bit. Also the air conditioner broke so i've been sleeping the past couple nights in very warm weather which has giving me a new appreciation for cold showers. But I am fairly excited about the possibilities of the place. I've been having a quite a bit of trouble contacting my soon to be roomate though what with him for all intents and purposes falling out of existence. For those of you who know who i'm talking about you wouldn't happen to know what happen to him would you?<br /><br /><br />

          Okay okay, so I just have to say that I'm sorry for not posting in a long time. I was a counselor at band camp (yeah, I know, laugh all you want) for 2 weeks and I just got back to my parents house from a week at the beach. I heard people were looking for me? I guess thats good. Well, I'm here, alive and kicking.<br /><br />
