          For those of you who are still undecided about this upcoming election, I've made this handy comparison chart between the two major candidates:<br /> <br /> Bush...<br />... voted "yes" on a bill that would give Monkeys the right to vote.<br />... is the number one cause of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).<br />... guest-starred on television's "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".<br />... has 18/00 strength, and his slain many beholders.<br />... invented the cotton gin (and consequently an alcoholic drink of the same name).<br />... sings back-up for Latin singing sensation Shakira.<br />... once found a Cocoa Puff in a box of Rice Crispies.<br /> <br /> Kerry...<br />... stole Christmas, 2 years in a row.<br />... is related to Skeletor.<br />... would win in a fight versus John Edwards.  Trust me.<br />... wrote his master's thesis on "Dungeons &amp; Dragons vs. Warhammer 40K"<br />... is known to some Native American tribes as Na'tiktoohay, or "He Who Created the Sky".<br />... is the real-life inspiration for "Mr. Holland's Opus".<br />... kicks ass at Halo.<br /> <br /> I hope these facts help all of you unsure voters to make a well-educated decision in November, as some of this information may actually be true.<br /><br />

          i'm well on my way to being an alcoholic. dear dear god god, not a day has gone by since my first post about becoming one that I haven't gone to work thinking of it as another road block towards brewed freedom. Every night I count down the hours and minutes until it's beer o'clock. When the clock&nbsp;reads midnight I&nbsp;read the home stretch, when I can park my car at the barracks and throw a couple down. Wondrous brew, how you enslave me with your fleeting comforts! That first sip of the night is really all I need--to open up that little brown 'fridge that we're all issued and reach for that cold longneck that's been calling my name all night long. Then I know I'm but a turn of the wrist and a triumphant first-sip stance away from OFFICIALLY-OFF-DUTY-DON'T-EVEN-MENTION-WORK-hood. It's beautiful. I could sit around (while drinking beer) thinking of all the great metaphors for beer and liberty, but I won't. It speaks for itself. So CHEERS!<br /><br />And for those of you that don't appreciate brew: shut up and drink more beer. I mean I <em>know</em> you want that +1 charisma, don't you?<br /><br />

          I know you must have heard every side of this argument by now, but please allow me to throw in my version. Let's make this personal.<br /> <br /> Let's just say, for example, we wanted to control the population of Blacks by trying to ban Black marriage.  See how silly that sounds?  Blacks would only (if anything) get defiant about all of it and hold their own ceremonies.  What really bugs me is that the Republicans are launching movements that tell us who we can't marry, what we can't do online, and all the while promising high speed internet to everyone and trying to pass legislation for the Draft at the same time. So, lets see, how many ways can Bush possibly piss me off at once? <br /> <br /> 1. Gay Marriage.  God forbid I turn gay someday because I will be god damned if I am told I can't do something like marry.   I am not even into marriage at all but every man and woman has the right to.  So its the same sex, so what?  All this bullshit about gay rights and how they are making everything equal, bah I say.  All this banning legislation is doing is slowing down the process.  I spoke to an intern at work last week who is from Texas (can you guess which side of the street she stands on?) and she, like many people I know, wanted to know why I hate Bush so much.   <br /> <p>2. Patriot Act.  So just what does the Patriot Act give the Bush administration the right to do? </p> <p></p> <blockquote>   <p>Well, for starters, it allows the FBI to monitor everything from e-mail to medical records to library accounts, providing frightening access to once private information. They can now legally wiretap phones, break into homes and offices, and access financial records without probable cause.   </p>     <p>The Patriot Act broadens terrorism to include "domestic terrorism" which could potentially be used to target activist groups within the country speaking out against Bush's treacherous deeds.   </p>     <p>The Patriot Act also disregards attorney-client privilege and authorizes government surveillance of previously confidential discussions.   </p>     <p>Immigrants can be detained indefinitely based on suspicion alone, and the Patriot Act aids the excessive amounts of deportations that are taking place. </p>     <p> Calling this the Patriot Act is quite a dangerous action within itself, because the implication follows: if you speak against the Patriot Act, well, you sure aren't being a good citizen in our country's time of need. When Bush labels his actions as the model of patriotism, he then classifies all dissent as un-American. While this may be comforting to him, it is actually an insult to patriotism. Protecting the Constitution and the Bill of Rights demonstrates a great respect for the government of this country and the rights of its citizens, and that sounds downright patriotic.  <br />   </p> </blockquote> <p>If I mentioned any couple of words/phrases that they hold in magic boxes @ DC about the President I would be tracked for 24 hours (E3R used to be visited 20 times a day by the Gov 2 years ago).  Then, if they felt like my words were harsh enough they could imprison me without stating in any specific reason.  Oh crap, 8% left on my laptop.  This bitchfest will have to continue another time.

(AP) — Kids be warned: Flushing your pet fish down the drain will not send it safely into the ocean as depicted in the movie "Finding Nemo."<br /><br />A company that manufactures equipment used to process sewage issued a press release Thursday warning that drain pipes do lead to the ocean—eventually—but first the fluid goes through powerful machines that "shred solids into tiny particles."<br /><br />"In truth, no one would ever find Nemo and the movie would be called 'Grinding Nemo,"' wrote the JWC Environmental company, which makes the trademarked "Muffin Monster" shredding pumps.<br /><br />In the unlikely event Nemo survived the deadly machines, the company added, he would probably be killed by the chlorine disinfection.</blockquote><br /><br /><b>EDIT:</b> The next time anyone copies and pastes massive blocks of page-destroying HTML, I go on a killing spree.

          Let it be known that Slipknot contains a volume of suck far greater than it would appear possible given the collective surface area of its members. They have consistently outdone themselves in suck-ness with each successive album. Now they are perched upon a threshold of suckitude so great that, should they cross it, they threaten to form a quantum singularity of suck powerful enough to swallow the entire universe. Universal heat-death is a far more remote possibility than Slipknot-induced <b>suck</b>-death.<br /><br />If you're not concerned about this, you should be.<br /><br />[shamelessly cloned from my personal blog]<br />

          <a href="http://www.dea.gov/pubs/pressrel/pr072204.html">http://www.dea.gov/pubs/pressrel/pr072204.html</a>  Seems that the rules concerning drug analouges are now being enforced. This is a predictable new development. After reading the press release, to be honest, I actually support the action by the DEA. Drug analogous are <i>dangerous</i>. I would accuse these merchants of being horribly reckless, because they in no way whatsoever at all were honest about the dangers of their products. The product descriptions consisted of "a picture of a molecule". While I have some very libertanian leanings about product liabilities for dangerous stuff, I think it should none-the-less at least be clearly marked that such things are almost certainly untested safety-wise, and potentially quite lethal when used outside of a labroatory. For example, one of the products at WWW.RACREASEARCH.COM was "5-MeO-AMT". Information on this substance can be obtained from the psychoactive library of Erowid [<a href="http://www.erowid.org/">www.erowid.org</a>]. "5-MeO-AMT", short for 5-methoxy-alpha-methyl-tryptamine, is active at the ludicrously low dosage of 1mg! [<a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_amt/5meo_amt_dose.shtml">http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_amt/5meo_amt_dose.shtml</a>] Such a small amount can ONLY be safely measured in a chemistry lab, on a high-grade milligram-accurate scale, which incidentally cost roughly somewhere between $1500 and $2000.

          Man, you never really realize how bad your childhood is until you find yourself rambling to a coworker about how screwy your parents are. I left my sister 4-5 years ago with them and the amount of damage done is...appauling.  Have you ever had a day dream where you are back at your house, you can't leave, there's nothing particularly wrong and yet nothing is quite right. You awaken to find yourself sweating and standing in someone else's office. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hmm, perhaps I began day dreaming while walking somewhere and now I'm in this person's office and they're just looking at me strangely. </span><br /> <br /> How annoying is it trying to tell a sick person to just hurry up and get well? Very annoying. My sister seems to be suffering from manic depression and high school (yes, I used high school as an example of illness). She's one of those people who think that Goths have a purpose and that most of them are smart. She even went so far to offend me today by saying McGruff the Crime Dog, the top dawg I work for, is stupid. I told her, "I'll bet you 200$ that in 10 years not only will those people not dress in black anymore, but they will be working for the National Crime Prevention Council." My uncle is trying to come up with excuses on why she acts the ways she does and he always comes to the conlusion I came up with yesterday after doing some time researching.<br /> <br /> Sometimes I believe that my parents are doing a royal job of screwing her up without even knowing it. Or she is just going through adolescense and is not as mature as I was when I was the same age. She thinks school is dumb and after she's out the world is just a playground. Well, I says to her, "it is sorta like a play ground". I rub my chin, then continue: <blockquote>Me: Yes, life is sorta like a playground.<br /> BT: it is?<br /> Me: well, life is like one of those slides you see at many playgrounds nowadays where the entire structure looks friendly on the outside because its made of soft plastic but when you are using it you always feel like everything is going too fast and every once in a while you collect too much static and it shocks the hell out of you. Once you reach the end, your hair is on end and you're very stressed out. People never stop throwing sand. Sexuality is like the swingset, some people are this way, some people are that way, and some people just like to sit in them and watch everyone else. If you're daring you check out the spinning wheel of doom. People like getting a rush out of that; there's always blood smeared somewhere on it. Some kids like to sit in the middle and slowly work their way into the pull of inertia, and some kids like to try to jump in later on, only to get knocked the <span style="font-style: italic;">fuck</span> out by the spinning metal bars. <br /> BT: this all means something, doesn't it</blockquote> I tried, at least. She gets joy out of hearing about people's pain, constantly curses in replacement for actual meaningful words, and always changes the subject in conversation to be negative, dark, painfully dreadful. When trying to find out things she enjoys doing I mentioned that I write short stories every now and again so when I mentioned that one of the titles was "Superhuman Suicide" her ears suddenly perked up. I will continue to try to help open her eyes that the world was a place meant for her to conquer and that there is room for more emotions than just dry, dark, and gross humor. But don't get me wrong, the dry, dark, and gross humor certainly has it's place.<br /> <br /> So I didn't have the best of lives when I was younger. So I have stories that many will never hear. So...what? I told BT that in the end it all adds to the irony. If my parents weren't total wackjobs then what would I have to overcome? In every good story there is something large to overcome and in my story I had to overcome 1. my fears 2. my parents 3. myself. I have already accomplished so much, and have so many things on my resume and so many more things to do before I'm gone.  Are you still a little screwy from your f'd up childhood? Share with us, comments are open.<br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, the secret number of the day is a low <span style="font-weight: bold;">9</span>.<br /> <br />

          An anonymous commenter from my last post pointed out that some people might not see the MBA, or Monkey Basketball Association as being politically correct. I was not, of course, making any comparisons between basketball players and monkeys; I just liked the thought of monkeys playing basketball (nothing beats a monkey slam dunk.  nothing). <br /> <br /> Regardless, I have pulled the plug on any future plans I may have had for the MBA, and replaced them with the hopefully more crowd-pleasing CHL, or Chimp Hockey League. Did I miss this commenter's point here? Perhaps, unless the point is to see chimps in uniform... which it undoubtedly is.<br /> <br />  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 220px; height: 220px;" src="http://i.myspace.com/02/95/1955920/15248649_l.jpg" alt="MHL All-Star" /><br /> </div><br />
