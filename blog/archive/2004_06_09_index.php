          Well, this may be really boring for everyone but it was really awkward for me. I go into work at my golf course for lunch because it's free for me and because I was out running errands and in the area anyway. So, I'm sitting at this bar talking to this girl who was working there and some old lady and her friends walk in and start pointing at me and stuff. She is whispering to her friends and staring at me, and I'm thinking "oh shit what did i do now?" She finally gets to the register and orders some beer or food or something that you would get at a bar and asks the girl working there something I didn't hear. Anyway, the girl says "Oh no, that's just Matt he works here." <br /><br />Then, the lady comes up to me and goes "Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you were the actor from my soap opera and I was going to ask you for your autograph." Turns out she thought I was some guy from General Hospital I never heard of, but now when people look at me weird I pretend they really think I'm "that one guy from general hospital." good stuff<br /><br />end<br />

          I have a story for everyone...here goes.<br /><br />I'm really excited because I haven't had Cottage Cheese in a really long time and I just bought some at Ukrops.  I get home and decide to wait to eat it so I can savor the taste later.  So a couple minutes ago I get out of the shower and get all ready to surf the web while eating my precious cottage cheese, and I dig the spoon in and take a huge bite...oh my god, it was the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted.  I try to remember if this is indeed what cottage cheese tastes like, but I don't think it's supposed to taste like <em>that</em>.  I search the label for some kind of expiration date, and there it is....June 1, 2004.  But wait, today is June 9, 2004.  Back to Ukrops I go to get my money back, and I don't think I will ever eat Cottage Cheese again.  EW.<br />

             Please don't let this site become the O'Reilly Factor.  Personally, I neither know enough nor care to know enough about the issues to take any sort of stance or make any kind of arguments, so I'm not going to get involved... so... there are other message boards where you can discuss politics.  <br /><br />   I WILL, however, congratulate Eric on his hip-hop-happenin' stance on Luke's de-arming at the hands of Lord Vader.  I whole-heartedly agree that the reason Luke took a hit (and consequently was fitted with a sleek robo-arm) was, in fact, that he didn't have a plan.  Plus Luke's kind of a weiner.  I mean, you don't see Han Solo losing any limbs, do you?<br /><br />   In closing, I'd just like to say, "Less Nader, more VADER."<br /><br />- the Kobold<br />

          Well not only did I use fancy Acronyms like WOMD and Presidential Facism comments. You cant forget about the Partial Birth Abortions with a Coat Hanger. Come on give me credit for everything now.<br />Its Ironic you named all the parties.... but then you make a bigger paragraph on our Mr President the Conservative Republican. Then you go on to say that you dont have Bias... hehe The larger paragraph in itself almost shows Bias heh<br /><br />" No one. And I mean NO one will be happy with any choices that President is making."<br />Isnt the President supposed to be the voice of the People? Saying because I can using fancy Acronyms like WOMD... what is soooo fancy about that? That I dont Know much? Then you compliment me... hehe well thanks.. after calling me a moron you give me props. How nice of you ;)<br /><br />I'm not trying to create any Biases... Im not trying to back any Nominee... Im not trying to be Bill O'Reilly. Im not trying to do a whole lot except Voice my Voice... Dont like it? Dont listen.<br /><br />Now onto Beelo,<br /><br />"the next time you write about the state of a country and its leadership, consider it relativistically against those of other countries, and ask yourself is it really worth complaining about."<br /><br />If it wasnt for Complainers what would get done? Who would control this country more then they already do? Big Companies, Monopolies, Bill Gates, Canadians etc etc. <br />Dont Complain? Sit Back and let them do whatever, whenever?<br />This country was founded by complainers... We didnt want to take England's shit... we didnt want to pay there taxes. We Complained and we took it to another level. The attitude that one person cant make a change is a wrong one.  Upton Sinclair and "muck rakers" of his time were considered complainers.. but if wasnt for him we still be eating rotted meat that sat in warehouses for weeks.<br /><br />But I respected all Ideas. I may not agree with them but I respect anyone that Has ANY. Its better then being a Peon that sits around and watches Joe Millionare and for Love or Money 23 while craming a Big Mac into your pie hole and having no Original thought in that dome piece.<br /><br />

          politics doesn't change a thing except quality of life. in order for people to change, the culture needs to change, and do you think that policy will change that? culture is based mostly (if not, at least a great amount) on religion, and i've just got this gut feeling that religion won't change for a long time. Why are there ethnic cleansings? Why are there terrorists? Why does any ONE group of people kill any other group of people? Culture clash, or the desire to maintain a certain one. We don't NEED oil, sure, but its essential to our way of life, and really, what else have you got if you don't have your way of life?<br /><br />perhaps i've adopted this line of thought from the military. don't get me wrong, i'm not trying to speak for all the military out there, but i've noticed a certain...cynicism regarding what our actual purpose is. we feel like what we do on a daily basis doesn't change anything, but in truth, we overlook the fact that that is precisely what we are doing--making sure nothing changes. Gas prices may fluctuate, and europeans may like you more or less abroad, but those things are trivial in comparison to the rights and way of life afforded to you by the government and our 'monkey' leadership that everyone is so quick to bash.<br /><br />the next time you write about the state of a country and its leadership, consider it relativistically against those of other countries, and ask yourself is it really worth complaining about.<br /><br />--slightly heated <br />

          Bone up on your information when it comes to politics.  Just because you can throw out fancy acronyms such as "WOMD" and write Nazi references about the President, does NOT mean you know much.  Anyone can have that silly hippy feeling about our President.  No one. And I mean NO one will be happy with any choices that President is making. You just can't do it.  No one will be happy with any decision that is made.  That is just how life is and how people are.  <br /><br />As for " the election is coming up ” know who the candidates are and their platform.  <br /><br />       Green party:  NADAR.  Tends to be of the left-wing liberal and very hippy oriented.  As time progressed he started to be more of a middle-liberal, siding with the REPUBLICANS.<br /><br />       DEMICRATS:   KERRY.  He runs PUBLIC OPINION POLLS every week and changes his platform to appease the general public.  (WHY would you want a president that only makes decisions that makes himself look good and beneficial to his name?)  <br /><br />       REPUBLICANS:   BUSH *TERM TWO* Conservative republican.  Might be putting a little TOO much focus on the war and not enough on S.S (hey, its going to effect each and everyone of us.  What was supposed to be a 'supplement' to our retirement is becoming nonexistent and something needs to change.... ANYONE ever thought about that??)  Bush has no only made discussions that the democrats have disliked about his war, but he has also made decisions that the republicans hated.  He did that because EACH case was done to his judgment of what was right.An honest man way of life.  His decisions may not be what YOU, or YOU, or even YOU want but there is a large part of this Country, along with other countries that side with him.  <br /><br /><br />Do your homework before you vote.  Check all media; don't just go to a liberal sources or a green sources or even a republican sources.  Better yourselves and know EVERY viewpoint.  Biasness is nothing more than weakness.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />***Village Idiot:  kudos for getting E3R started right were we left of <br /><br /><br />      <br />

          <img src="http://www.devlogik.com/www/E3R_2/blog/AhRab.JPG" /><br />Well just to start off this place lets start on a political note.<br /><br />Apparently the government (I think Powell) officialy stated that Iraq has no offical or direct link to Al qada. No Direct link to Al Qada and no WOMD.... hmm kinda makes you wonder why we attacked this country in the first place.<br />Ill give you a clue its Black, its thick, and its not an LL Cool J porn.<br />Now this is where people say "Oh But Sadam was a threat to us" HELL now because of that 79% of the world is a threat to us.<br /><br />NO ONE likes Americans. But thats ok because I think Americans love themselves enough for the whole world.<br />You know why no one likes Americans? Because we walk around saying how we are the Best Country in the World. We dont follow our own rules and somehpw we entangled ourselves in the Conflict in the Middle East. Currently we support the Jewish population.... and thats maybe 40-55% of the population over there... if that. Im sure its not the majority. Well essentialy we support the Jews.... when the Jews have been in a war with those A-Rabs since the dawn of time and reality television. Well... those A-Rabs dont like that. We help the enemy, that makes us the enemy. Its logical... and if someone helped Iraq in the War... trust us we wouldn't nicely say stop that. We would flash fry them until we had their oil too.<br /><br />Firstly too at least Quel this problems somewhat. We have to stop supporting the Hebrews hehe....we cant give them Weapons, Supplies and help. Thats not Our Problem.. I dont know why we make it our problem...<br />Trust me... the entire WORLD is fucked up. We do got it good here. But Sadam isnt even the Worst dictator. There are people in Africa that go around villages chopping mother fuckers up with Machetes and removing babies with coat hangers. Doing all sorts of Ruff and Tumble stuff so its not like we are the saviors of the world.<br />If your out of the country I would highly recommend hiding your Americaness because everyone else thinks otherwise. We are a pestilence on this earth but we dont need to be. <br /><br />Now Im not saying I have the Complete answer to this problem. But I can also tell you who doesnt have any answer to this problem, Fuehrer Bush. We need to get proper leadership. We are in luck... the election is coming up...<br />Now Sadly I dont see any of the nominee's being that strong of a leader...<br />But a trained monkey can run better then this douche.<br />If you disagree feel free to shove your head 3-5 Inches into your rectum and ask for a coat check...<br />Because Im sure they care :) <br /><br />Of course this is a ramble.. Things Ive picked up here and there. So it may be slightly skewed. But heavily based in fact. Sooooo come at me you Nay Sayers<br />

          Holy crap!  It's back, it's back!!!!  I can't even begin to tell you guys how excited I am to be posting on E3-R again.  I promise this time that there will not be drama like there was last time...ugh, I apologize for all that mess a while ago.  Anyway, I guess I don't really have much to say right now, except that I hope everyone's summer is going well so far, and I can't wait till everyone starts posting.  Yay!<br />

     <font class="TallRed">Ok, enough about you...let's talk about me.<a name="108676918173056428">&nbsp;</a></font>
		<div class="blackjustified" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;border-top:3px solid #cccccc;border-bottom:1px solid #333333;border-left:1px solid #cccccc;border-right:1px solid #cccccc;">
          First of all, for those who haven't asked me personally...what happened to E3R??<br /><br />Well, funny story actually, heh, umm...I was scammed. It was freshman year, I was poor as hell and this domain registrar sent me something in the mail that said it would renew e3-r.com for 20$ cheaper than my current host. I was so excited over it that I never thought it could have been fake. The bastards took my 15$ and my domain. I was pissed off but relieved at the same time. At that moment in E3R history we were recieving tons of hits, all the *good posters* weren't interested anymore because of the nonsense that was evolving. Part of the problem was that one member of the DevlogikSymbiot was missing- the government moderator. We'll keep his name out of things but now we have a better more prevalent member who will keep things in shape and do it well.<br /><br />All of the talent left and continued posting in other places, and they continue to do so. I tried to keep up with most of them but we all kinda scrambled for something else. I kept myself rather busy with school work when I had to think of a topic for my 15 page Research paper. I chose to reexamine my theory of the Electronic Third and suddenly something clicked. The result lies <a href="http://www.devlogik.com/www/E3R_2/texts/josephburdick_theE3Rtheory.php">here</a> (comments welcome). After getting A's in both classes I used E3R in this semester (this layout being one final project) I decided heh, since I'm here, why not just continue and open it back up again? So I did, and here we are.<br /><br />"FSEVN" is making people a little curious. It's just a name. If you want to know any deep meaning behind it, it's just the key on the keyboard that was used for HELP on most DOS-based machines back when the primary langauge was BASIC. HELP seems fitting but it would confuse readers if that was my display name. E3R_J is a name that has been buried along with all of the drama that existed. I'm a new person now and thus, I deserve a new name for a new beginning. <br /><br />My powers as Owner of E3R aren't as strong as most would think. If a rule is ever adopted, it goes through the DevlogikSymbiot first. The team is composed of four guys and one female and everything I control they control with me. Oh, and by the way, the "Couples Rule" was scrapped before E3R hit the dust almost 2 years ago.<br /><br />I'm a Junior now at Virginia Commonwealth University. My major has been changed from Business to Marketing and I am currently working at <a href="http://www.ncpc.org">NCPC</a>, a non-profit organization in DC that is responsible for things that virtually every American has heard about. There I am the assistant of the Director and I am also working with the Web-design team as a designer consultant/marketer. <br /><br />Because of my new major at school and its requirement for a mac computer, my family is going to help me with the purchase of a brand-new dual processor G5 w/ a 20" Apple display. Right after E3R went down I became obsessed with mac systems and soon after became a huge advocate for open-source operating systems such as Linux and GNU software. Since, I have migrated serveral people to use software that I use on my windows systems. They enjoy them a lot and are learning plenty about the joys of screwing MicroSoft. Anyway, I need to sleep so I can wake up in about 5 hours to pack and run some errands. I leave today @ 5pm to D.C. where I begin my professional career.<br /><br />Before I go, I would just like to thank everybody who has posted and will post--as well as all my readers--if it weren't for you people I don't know how I would be in the situation that I'm in. With the help of E3R, which isn't just a website, its the PEOPLE, I have accomplished many things. Without it, I probably wouldn't have recieved this scholarship. So to all: <strong>thank you</strong>.<br /><br />Good night/morning.<br />

          The post below this one is an example of the new posting feature for E3R. Thanks to the universal system Blogger/Google is using, every member of E3R can post by phone. Honestly, this will be really helpful when I'm riding the metro in the mornings and have nothing better to do. It's completely free and there's no waiting involved! All you do is (first setup an account @ <a href="http://www.audioblogger.com">audioblogger</a> by using the same Username and Password you use to sign into E3R's Blogger system) then all you do is call a certain number, put in your pin, and speak! when you're done sayin whatever you need to say, press the pound key and you're done. Wow, this is going to be very addicting.<br />
