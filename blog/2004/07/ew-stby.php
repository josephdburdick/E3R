          <blockquote>"wtfdtm?"<br />"lmfaorofl."</blockquote><img src="http://www.tritronicsinc.com/battery/digibatt.jpg" style="border:1px solid #000000;" align="left" hspace="3">A couple days ago, I was sitting in a meeting at the long executive table listening to these Vocus people spout about their new software enhancements and my stomach began feeling really crummy. Then, I began to notice that swallowing was a little different and I had a copper taste in the back of my throat. As soon as the meeting was over, I walked quickly to the bathroom. I began trying to cough up what I had been swallowing for 20 minutes or so and I looked at the paper towel to see it was spattered with blood.<blockquote>Brain: Blood? Hmm, thats wierd. Usually it comes out of peoples' noses not...you know...their mouth.</blockquote>Lately, because I did so much work during my first couple weeks at NCPC, I have been doing extremely boring work. Like *real* intern stuff. Another one of my supervisors discovered me doing these trivial tasks and was became very irritated. Her identity will be represented by the letter "M".<blockquote>M: Just what in the hell are you doing?<br />Joe: cutting and pasting...oldschool style.<br />M: Don't they have...stickers? that you can just PRINT on?<br />Joe: Stickers? What sorcery is this?!?</blockquote>I grabbed an undercooked hotdog with chili and cheese piled on top of it, a bag of greasy chips, and a soda (gasp!) for 2$ on Connecticut Avenue. For 2 bones thats a killer deal. Most packages with that many calories usually cost you at least 3 or at least charge you sales tax. So I had my chilidog and went on my merry way. While I was adding in contacts into one of my supervisor's Outlook contacts (don't ask) I came across a funny name.   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Richard E. Wrinkle</span>-- I kid you not. I thought it was so funny that I sent an email to my uncle and he answered back with this:<blockquote>I had a job once where I saw thousands of names.  I topped the list with: <br /><br />Phok Yu, Martin Batcock, and ... drumroll please...<br /><br />Crystal Beaver.</blockquote>May God have mercy on those poor souls. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Help! I'm in debt!</span> Its okay, I've been in debt for a while and 4300$ will be going towards a new computer. I'm feeling a little uneasy about the purchase now however. Every Mac person I talk to is like "Dude, it's well worth it!" while other people are like "1200$ for a flippin' monitor? Jesus Christ- just go dual monitors, dude." I know the original plan was to give my sister the comp when she got to college but...ehhh....I could build her a computer for the price of one paycheck so...I dunno. <br /><br />All I know is that if I don't get into any fun with someone I know or don't know I'm going to go ballistic soon. I just haven't been having much fun lately and I know it sounds selfish but wtf everyone needs some joy every now and then. Every time I turn around I need to be calling some jackass who won't return my phone calls or a company who changes their number just about everytime I attempt to complain. I'm so sick of the fucking telephone already. There are a couple of technologies that I want to see put to rest before I die:</span><blockquote>1. Land Telephones- Because I hate dumbasses who call themselves tech support when they can't get a god damn line to work for 4 months.<br />2. Combustion Engines- So you're hanging onto a wheel that turns the tires that is right behind a huge, heavy piece of steel that is exploding at a *relatively* steady interval. <i>Exploding</i>. This kind of shit should have been taken care of in the 90's people.<br />3. Botox- Look people, your ugliness is Nature's way of trying to control the population of the human race. Don't fuck it up for everyone else just because you think you look silly. If you were pretty before and something happened to you thats a different story. No wait, I change my mind...never use Botox.<br />4. Weight loss drugs- THEY DON'T WORK. GET OVER IT. YOU <b>CAN'T</b> POLISH A TURD. So by sitting down all the time and popping pills all the time its going to screw up your body in many ways. In your fight to live longer you die sooner; that makes tons of sense, Stupid.<br />5. Filing Cabinets- hmm...a storage device that weights 500lbs when it's in full use and has an absolute maximum, requires constant attention to keep up to date, look dreadful, and takes up 95% of your already-too-small office. You <i>could</i> stick the piece of crap next to the window but chances are your filing skills suck and the ever-growing temple would block out the sunlight for you and 3 other offices.<br />6. Lithium Ion Batteries- because its been how decades since batteries first hit the shelves and we JUST PAY MORE AND MORE FOR THEM. Of all the technologies that should be declining in price with the demand of today it should be batteries. SO WHY THE &amp;$#@! AM I PAYING 8 DOLLARS FOR 8 BATTERIES?!<br />7. Soap Operas- quite possibly the worst device ever created by human hands. This is probably what will make me finally end my own life after spending my last 500$ on a cybernetic transplant when I'm 132 years old. So close to the years of Moses and yet because of crappy daytime television I will lose my patience and unplug my shitty Lithion Ion Battery pack.</blockquote>I'm a tired old man. Only 20 and I have 3 decades to bitch about. And I'm poor. Anybody want to buy a 32 harddrive RAID with hotswap SCSI drives? Controller included- and this bad boy has 4 power redundant power supplies. Hawt.<br />

				hey since blogger is not allowing me to be able to do anything im just going to publish as a anonymous-lol. hi im burrochapadogrl and i think this site is pretty awsome and about what joe said about things that just shuldnt be- i agree. <br />i guess batteries have gotten so expensive bc noone can afford to buy them anymore, so they are slowing going extinct anyways-lol. <br />botox- yes ppl, all your doing is just becoming more like michelle jackson *shudders* personally i dont see whats so horrible with aging? its life, why must you inject poisons into your freakin face?<br />dieting pills- ATTENTION FAT PPL your fat, and theres nothing wrong with it. but if you want to loose that fat, get off your ass, and GO OUTSIDE. bc just sitting around and chugging those pills doesnt do anything at all. and in many cases ppl had died from diet pill overdoes bc there are stuff in there that raises your blood pressure and destroys your body- AND THAT IS NOT GOOD-duh.<br />soap operas- seriously! how many times does someone have to die in a show!?!? and who watches those shows?!?!? i mean who wants to watch a show about a bunch of  drug/drunk/suicidal/murder/all most everything that is evil/beautiful ppl who are out to have sex with/kill each other to get back at others AT EVERY FREAKING EPISODE THERE IS!!!  its like watching dragonballz! the same thing happens over and over that you soon or later just want to throw the tv out the window or smash it  into fragments until its turns into dust. THEY ARE EVIL!!! EVIL LIKE BARNEY THE DINOSAUR AND THE POPE!!! *runs out of breath and tries to calm down* ...*cough* sorry about that... hee hee.<br /> but a few things that i want to see b4 i die: <br />gays get to marry- bc whats the big deal, when all that matters is that they love each other and NO religion should be teaching to descriminate others. its just wrong that ppl thinks that god teaches you to be prejudice against others, bc he doesnt, its man who does.<br />spontanuous combustion- that someone just spontanuously combusts THAT WOULD BE SWEET!!!!<br />i win a million bux- so i can buy my bro a computer that he likes, my mom a new kidney, and my dad a new building for my dad's church, and myself....hmmm...i dont know, i never thought of it- mainly bc i know it will never happen-lol.<br /><br />i guess that would be it on my list of things that i would like to see happen b4 i die. -bye<br /><br />joe's sis,<br />burro<br />
