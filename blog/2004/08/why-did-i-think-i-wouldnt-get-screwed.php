          Note: This may be a condensed version, I don't feel like writing this out now but I might say it all to avoid finishing it later.<br /><br />Folks, I may well be psychic. I never believe in that kind of thing, but lately I've been too right too often. Two weeks ago, I went on my annual two week trip to Memphis to visit family. Just before I left I got the feeling that I was about to experience a repeat of a nasty turn of events from three years ago. In short, a girl I was really into went back to her ex-boyfriend (of many months) and decided to give him her virginity while she was at it, whilst I was away. When I got home, she announced this to me as though I was to be happy for her. I didn't think Shannon was going to go back to her ex, but I was sure I was about to go through mostly the same thing.<br /><br />The day after I arrived in Memphis, I called Shannon and made plans with her for August 6. One week later, I was horribly grief stricken with a feeling that Shannon had started dating another guy, and that this was going to cause her to forget all about our date (but not a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). It took me two days to get over that, during which I matured a lot and came to understand many important things about myself (Intelligence + Self-Awarness + I Ching = Maturing).<br /><br />I got back on Wednesday and called Shannon to announce my safe arrival, and to check in on our plans. I asked her if her plans had changed, or if she was still free Friday night (tonight). She didn't know what I was talking about, so I reminded her and again asked if she would be available. She replied, "I don't know, that depends on.....you're coming to work Friday, right? Talk to me about it then." Today at work all seemed very well, Shannon was extremely pleased to see me and approved of my haircut and new glasses (which, dare I say it, make me mildly attractive). Some hours later, we went on an extended series of business-related errands. This turned out to be some wonderful time with her, which I could go on and on about. However, at about the 3/4 mark, IT happened. I asked about tonight, and she said that *Male Name* wouldn't like it if she went out with me tonight. She said he was on her every second of every hour, and that he didn't want her going out with any other guys (I took this not to mean a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>). She said this matter of factly, not a shred of disdain in her voice. I said, "Who cares?! It's not like you're dating." This ranks right up there with that scene from Young Frankenstein "Could be worse, could be raining." You guessed it, they ARE dating.<br /><br />I responded with unadulterated shock. She just laughed and said "Come on *My Name*, you knew that!" I rather pointedly told her that I didn't, and laid out exactly what I knew before I left (in short, that she had just left her ex). I was livid, but I only showed it in the rhythm of my speech. She just said that she and this guy were "talking" last week and now were passed that. By the way, *Male Name* is a mechanic at work (that we rarely see up front). The last time I heard "talking" used that way was 7 years ago, and that wasn't a happy day either. All the other times she mentions this guy have to do with his jealousy and control over her. I almost said "Silly me, I thought you had self resepect." I didn't, but I was more disappointed in her for what happened than I was angry. That time 7 years ago was the first in a 2 year string of my playing the role of Duckie from Pretty in Pink (though not that extreme). I didn't ask about him or talk about it for the rest of the trip, fearing that my disappointment was a warning that I was heading into Duckie territory.<br /><br />Later, while she was pumping gas, I had my annual summer epiphany and was completely fine. I even told her, I said, "Remember all that angst back there? Forget it, I'm fine now." She asked why, and that started a discussion of my strange annual enlightenments. I'd never talked about them with anyone before, and she was genuinely interested. After all the talk of my high standard for my own reasoning (which would require a very long post to explain) and such, she seemed to have a lot more respect for me. I didn't think she lacked respect for me before, but she looked at me like some kind of sage (as opposed to "My parents looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears." from A Christmas Story). However, the whole trip was a bit like a <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">date</span>, in terms of conversation and signals exchanged. She made an effort to look me in the eye whenever possible, and I returned fire. She says I have "Mel Gibson eyes", and my new glasses accentuate them. Just as well, I think she has the most beautiful eyes humanly possible. I swear, she wants me more now that she's with him. I know how that sounds, but I'm dead serious.<br /><br />I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm staying out of it. I'd like to think that he's just her rebound guy. I don't care what she does with him (as opposed to three years ago when the girl's sexual escapades crushed me), I'd rather she go celibate after him than be her rebound guy. Emotionally I'm rabid that this kind of bullshit still goes on in my life, but cognitively I'm okay with it. I'm not worried or anything like that, and I'm decreasingly paying attention to my emotions on the matter. I'm going to sit back and watch what happens, only talking about it if she asks (and even then, of course, with some caution). Next week is my last week at work before I start school, unless I have to impede my buffer week before classes to get something finished. I hope she comes to her senses before I stop seeing her daily, I'd hate to get out of the loop with this going on. Of course, I'll keep contact with her, but I won't be in the thick of things anymore. Judging by how hard it was to make plans with her when we had roughly the same schedule (and I saw her everyday), it will be near impossible to see her once I get going at VCU. And that's supposing *Male Name* doesn't have anything to do with it.<br /><br /><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="font-size:100%;"><blockquote></blockquote></span><blockquote></blockquote></div><br /><br />
