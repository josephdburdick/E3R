          Okay, I will not pretend to call myself a programmer like some in the world do. It seems these days anyone who can write a line of code thinks they are a programmer. I have heard people who know basic HTML try to say they are prgrammers and I just about choke on my own spit hearing this. Years ago, I programmed in Basic and Pascal.. yuck! So I can say I have an understanding but am hardly knowledgable.<br /><br />With that said, the question to Java depends on one thing to me. As I understand it, and feel free to tell me if I am mistaken, there are two Java languages. There is Java that is a bonafide language, and then Java Script, which is as its name suggests, simple script. As I understand it, Java Script is used on the net for websites and such, and I tend to like what I have seen of it. It is versatile and can be used for everything from eye candy to useful web based applications. With the Java language, I have to say I cannot stand it. I worked for a company a few years ago that use a Java based application as its bread and butter application for interfacing with the various networks and databses the company used. It was the slowest, most bloated, archaic piece of shit I have ever laid my hands on. I spent the majority of my day hurrying up and waiting, and at times I wanted to throw my fucking monitor over the side of my cube. So my personal opinion on Java is it is crap. I completely understand that this may be due to lousy programmers, the above mentioned people that think they are programmers, so I say again, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG! :)<br /><br />This next part will only be of interest to true eggheads.. Hopefully they may get a laugh out of it.<br /><br />Hehehe, even worse for me today. The company I work for now, Washington Mutual, uses OS/2 Warp. And to make this worse, they run it in a Virtual PC container!!!!!! You should have seen my jaw drop when I started for my first day. When I got there, it was running straight on our PCs, the Virtual PC came later. This has helped, but you should have seen OS/2 running on a P4 with 512MB ram and an onboard Nvidia chipset. I swear it was as if OS/2 didn't have a clue what do do with the memory above 32MB. The HDD's were split into 5 partitions as OS/2 couldn't read above so many GB. Mart of the job me in closing loans entails the typing over and over, paragraphs of the same generic crap for Deeds of Trust, and Promissory Notes, there was no "notebook", Word, Excel, etc.. All typing all day long, no cut and paste. Shoot Me! I asked one of the techs why we used this OS and he told me it was for security issues, they were able to lock EVERYTHING down. One example was that the only things on the desktop that employees could use were LoanWorks(our central app), and Netscape. He explained to me that everything else was blocked. Really? I proceeded, in front of him to open Netscape, hash the c drive, c:/, navigate to the "win" directory, start up Win 3.1(which OS/2 is based on), install Word, Excel, and I even found a copy of Instant Messenger that ran on Win 3.1. My next problem was connecting AIM through the proxy. I looked in the cfg file for Netscape and found the URL Netscape uses to grap the proxy info. I opened word, wrote a link to the Proxy file, saved the doc as an html file, opened it in Netscape, did a right click, save target as, opened the saved proxy cfg file, input the server info into the AIM perferences, and that was that. The look on the techs face was priceless, it was as if his whole world had come crashing down. Now all of our PCs are WinXP with OS/2 running in the Virtual PC, which just leaves me to that much more havoc. One of the problems we have at work is that we are unable to email documents from LoanWorks to the title companies for borrowers to sign. It is very frustrating, we have to print the docs and then FedEX them, if anything was wrong, it required a reprint and a courier. I was in the proccess of writing a simple driver that would save the print spool to a PDF file that could be emailed, but alas we are all being laid off on Sep 30th, so I shitcanned that. Imagine the money that could be saved on FedEX and courier fees.... Hmm... we are the largest savings and loan company in the nation, and we can't even email.. I wonder why our company is losing money and our office is being shut down. MORONS! LOL Anyway, my egghead anecdote for the day.<br /><br />A side question for anyone here. Over time, I have had various pieces of crapware that has installed itself into my system. I have deleted it when I have found it, but now in my task manager, I find that I have 6 copies of SVCHOST.EXE, and a few other odd proccesses running, ALG.EXE, and MSSRV.EXE etc... These are Windows modules that were called on becuase of the crapware. Does anyone know how to track down what is causing these modules to start up at boot so that I can figure out which ones are truly being used by the system, and which ones are just eating memory? I know what some are thinking right now... Linux... cool cool, Linux is nice, I will give you no argument, but Linux is not good for me as I have certain applications that I need WinXP in order to run, and the apps I have used in Linux to do these same tasks are just as bloated as their WinXP counterparts.<br /><br />So there it is, another one of my all over the place useless posts. Hey J, I used paragraphs this time... Do I get a pat on my back for that? :)<br />

				That was a great post!  This just solidifies everyone's opinion that I am a true egghead, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As to your question about tracking down processes, check out Process Explorer from SysInternals.  Matter of fact, just go ahead and download every free thing they offer, it's all great.  I have a whole section of my Start menu dedicated to them.  Their site is at http://www.sysinternals.com<br /><br />By the way, this was posted in Linux (as were most of my other posts).<br /><br />-Robby<br />

				Mostly Cubase SX 2.0 is my main concern. I have seen some of the other DAW packages for Linux, but they are not nearly as powerful, and to run something like lindows will not work for me as Cubase itself is a MASSIVE resource hog. The main problem with emulating under linux are the latency issues this would cause in Cubase and it is simply not feasable or practical at this time. I know many here do not like Microsoft, and I understand your reasons I do like the module based concepts Linux provides. Windows has these abilities also, the problem and major major difference is in Linux, you add what you need, which fine and good, unless you are someone who is unsure hot to do this, windows is the opposite where you get everything and have to subtract that which you don't need and this creates the same problem on the flip side. Also I am upgading next month to the Athlon64 FX and I am not sure if Linux has the capabilites as of yet to make use of the power. As it stands right now, there is a "hybrid" XP64 out that will take advatage of the 64bit processor, but in being a hybrid, it ia akin to Win95 and its dual 16/32 bit code. Microsoft is promising a 64 bit OS, but it looks like we are waiting 2 more yers for the Longhorn release. Ho Hum..<br /><br />And to the Linux/Mac crowd.... Have you noticed in using DesktopX how windows suddeny has the Linux/Mac capabilities for animating the desktop, icons, etc.... :)I have a strong feeling that much of Longhorn is going to be open source. It is the only logical thing for MS, and I think this is also indicated at their strong push into other aspects of the pc, the Xboxm etc. Thanks for the link Rob, I will check into it. Congress is trying to write legislation that will make the games these malware companies are using akin to breaking and entering into your house. Let us all hope they succeed.<br />

				You're welcome, I'm always trying to advertize those people.  Linux has got AMD64 nailed down better than anyone at this point, but I don't have time to write about it now.  If you want, email me and I'll let you in on the deal.  Being a geek, I sometimes have to ask people "Do you really want an answer to that question?"  This is not one of those cases, except to ask you if you want any more detail than "Yes, Linux can give you a fully 64-bit environment for the AMD64 platform, with simultaneous support for 32-bit code/binaries if you need it."<br /><br />-Robby<br />

				Almost forgot, make sure you go with Socket 939 when you upgrade.  No sense in buying into a form factor that's at the end of its life cycle.<br />

				Yeah, I am definitely looking at the socket 969, the damn price is through the roof though. Also, I am waiting until someone makes an AMD board that I can run the dual NVIDIA 6800's with the SLI connectors too. Only one Intel board supports it so far.<br /><br />I am curious on the Linux 64bit statement. I wouldn't mind running Cubase under Lindows if this is the case as the 64bit chip should kill any lag the 32's have. I am not sure if you have used any of the premium DAW programs, but latency is a SERIOUS issue wich is one of the things that holds me back from Linux.<br /><br />Thnaks for the info though.<br />
