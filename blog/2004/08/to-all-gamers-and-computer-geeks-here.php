          Has anyone here played Doom 3 yet? I normally cannot stand most shooters as they are pretty much blow up everything in sight and are mindless. My preference for shooters is usually Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, Siphon Fliter etc.. When I tried the beta a few months back, I was very disappointed. Now the release version is here and this game is fucking incredible. Id has done a wonderful job of making sure this thing runs well on low end systems and high end systems. Currently I am running an AMD XP+ 2600 overclocked, Nvidia GeForce 5200 with 128mb overclocked in AGP 8X mode, 1gb of PC3200 ram, a Soundblaster Audigy 1, and an 80gb 7200 rpm ATA 133 HDD. Not a big calculator, but not an SGI machine either. The graphics and sound are phenominal! The shadowing and dynamic lighting really bring the game out, and they have exploited many new DX9 features such as visual rippling from heat sources among other things. I am running the game at 1024 res with everything turned on but the antialiasing. Even with the AA off, there is almost no tearing whatsoever. As good as this thing looks, I am half tempted to go get a GeFore 6800 so I can run it in Ultra Mode. I know some of you all just groaned and are screaming ATI at me as we speak, but if you go read the reviews, the Nvidia GPU is kicking the living shit out of the ATI GPU, and the Doom3 engine is looking poised to bump the Quake/Unreal engine for the next few years. Soundwise, it blows me away, ID has apparently gotten together with Creative and EMU and written special standards for EAX2 in the game. There is an unbelievable amount of ambience, reflections, and doppler effects. This game is simply the best thing I have seen come to market in some time. For anyone who complained about the 10 years it took to bring this one back, it was worth the wait. My only complaint with this game is the flashlight, you cannot have the flashlight and a weapon enabled at the same time. The effect of this makes the game harder which isn't so bad. The AI is great also, enemies never stand there and wait for you, if they hear or see your ass 100yds away, they come after you.<br /><br />Forgot to mention, there is a setting in the config file that will allow all characters to have independent shadows. I know your thinking games already do this, but enable it in this game and see what you have been missing. It reminds me of Toca Race Driver 2, where the sun doesn't just cast shadows, it literally reflects off of everything independently. Also, you find things like warped glass in here that also ripples and distorts as you walk by it.<br /><br />

				Hmm a duct tape mod... Looks good, I may use it after I beat the game and move up to the Insanity Difficulty. Otherwise, I like the challenge..and it is a bitch at times trying to shoot something that is moving around in a completely dark room. I am surprised that ID didn't give vision enhancement settings like the night vision or infrared in Splinter Cell. This guy is supposed to be a marine in the late 21st Century. I generally stay away from cheats. I have a friend that goes out and spends $50 on a game, and $20 on the book to beat it.. what is the point in playing if you are doing that.<br /><br />I haven't tried the multiplayer yet. Still getting though the game as I have only had it a day and a half.<br /><br />My wish for Xmas... Descent 4! I know some will say Freespace was Descent 4.. hardly!<br /><br />I seriously think I may go ahead and build me an AMD64FX box now, since Intel fell on their face last week in their admission that they are running months behind their scheduled production for new chips. As far as I am concerned, AMD has been kicking their asses pound for pound and performance to cost for the last ten years. I also will upgrade my vid card. I am going to wait though as I want to see how ATI responds with this very heavy handed smack in their faces by Nvidia. If they can't fix the problem with a driver solution, I will probably go with an Nvidia PCI-Express card.<br />

				The IDDQD thing was funny—I still remember that code too. Who could forget? Any self-respecting geek knows that was the passcode to immortality. I'm putting a replacement motherboard in my PC today or tomorrow (after three months of it being down with a dead mobo) and I have the Doom 3 discs sitting on my desk. It will be fun, I'm sure. Still need to finish Far Cry though.<br /><br />About the ATI vs. NVIDIA thing, the GeForce 6800 is kicking ass in Doom 3's engine right now, but that's because NVIDIA had the Doom 3 beta before ATI and optimized their drivers. The betas of the next drivers from ATI show large improvements in performance on all their 9x00 and X600/800 cards as well. I find ATI offers better price/performance. If I didn't have to replace my motherboard I'd be grabbing a Radeon 9800 Pro for $190 or so, but alas, I do not have the bling. Doom should run okay though, at 800 x 600 and medium detail, on my Athlon 2000+ w/ 512MB of RAM and a GeForce4 Ti4400 128MB. We'll see anyway.<br />

				From what I am reading, there is more to it than simple drivers. Id and Nvidia are saying they worked very closely, and that the new Nvidia GPU's were designed with this engine and DX9 in mind. I could care less either way, their fighting tranlates to eye candy heaven for us! I used to be all about Nvidia as they knocked 3dFX right the fuck off their pedestal. Then ATI, one of the oldest graphics chip makers, somehow comes back from the depths of obsoleteness to give us some of the best and fastest advancements we have seen in ages. Good Lord, does anyone here remember the first "3D Polygon" games? Virtua Fighter comes to mind. I can remember being extrememly dissapointed at the time as I was so used to "sprites". The poly characters had no detail or depth compared to their pixelated siblings. I am a believer now!!!! In the same realm, Alienware is coming out with dual CPU, dual GPU machines this year. NICE! And if you really want to hit the high end. GO over and look at these boxes. I dare anyone here to find me a better system.... reasonable, don't come back at me with a freaking SGI box, or BigBlue.. ;-) These things have a 16gb ramdisk, just for starters, that runs at somewhere around 8gb/s if I remember correctly. Combine it with their custom WINXP and a 4 panel 90inch lcd monitor, and your about to vomit just looking at it....<br /><br />http://www.go-l.com<br /><br />My wish for the near future is independent goggles. What I mean by that is goggles that are NOT a controller, but also more than mere "3D" shutter glasses. I want to be able to play a flight sim and look around outside the cockpit independently from the steering of the craft. Or when I am playing Madden, go out for a catch and be able to look over my shoulder for the pass while still running toward the endzone. Or when driving... oh, you got the point? My bad.. LOL... It bugs me they haven't done it yet, it would just be a matter of mapping to the hat...right?<br /><br />Your machine should run Doom without a problem. I am running mine @800x600. I would suggest turning off the AA. With AA off there is not much noticeable difference, while you will get the jaggies on some edges, I have noticed virtually no tearing. There were some settings that had some problems on the non DX9 cards. I do not think the GeForce4 was a DX9 card, but I am not positive on that. I jumped from a 3 to the 5200. I do remember though that those cards were no different in the TI and Ultra models, but for the Bios. You can find Bios upgrades on the net and "unlock" your TI so to speak if you felt so inclined.<br /><br />On a different game.. Has anyone here played Alias on PC? WHAT A CRAPPER OF A GAME!!!! I think they ported it over from XBox and didn't bother to do anything about the controls. Using the keyboard and mouse bites ass, and personally, I will take my keyboard and mouse setup over a gamepad any day. Well for most games. I go with a gamepad on my sports games, and I have a flight stick, and a wheel/pedals for my other games.<br /><br />I have issues!<br />

				I just have to slip this in while I am at it... So sorry Mac users but my PC will hang with the Macs any day in the realm they bragged of owning for so long. Graphics, sound, and multimedia production. As far as I am concerned, Steve Jobs should be taken to the desert and quartered for squandering Apple Computers. I used to be a big Apple fan. I learned programming back in the day using Pascal on a IIc. He has tried to run this company like it is a freaking head shop catering to niche users. PROPRIETARY will spell the doom of any piece of equipment, and he has succeeded with great expertise at reminding us all of that point. Even when he switched to the PCI bus years back, in an attempt to make MACs more compatable, he used a proprietary version, unlike the IBM/Intel boxes 99% of the rest of the world uses. As I said in my last post about the 3DFX/Nvidia/ATI war... we the users benefit from their competition. <br /><br />I am reminded of a little fight in the late 80's between IBM and the rest of the PC market. If anyone remembers the IBM PS1 & PS2, they might remember something called the Microchannel Architecture or MCA Bus. IBM built it as the successor to the ISA Bus. Well about the same time, the PCI Bus was also released by the group that comes up with standards for equipment, I can't remember what they are called, but they are the people who define things like CAT5, VGA plugs, etc. Anyway, they agreed on the PCI standard. The MCA was way ahead of the PCI in performance, so much so that my little 286 MCA box was running circles around the 486's, and even some Pentiums my buddies had. I was even running the all new King of OS's, WIN 95! ;-) God that makes me feel old. Anyway, a 286 was not supposed to be able to run 95. My machine was winning in almost every benchmark we tried. So IBM had built a much better mousetrap. They were so sure of themselves and that the world would coming foaming at the mouth for it that they failed to heed a very valuable lesson from Sony and the much more superior format BetaMax that we had all seen only ten years earlier. IBM decided to charge everyone a per unit surcharge to put MCA slots in their boxes... Okay, let me see.... Free PCI.... surcharged MCA.... Who won? How many people have even heard of MCA now? <br /><br />This is also the lesson that Steve Jobs unfortunately cannot seem to heed. Apple has been so close to death so many times now it is rediculous. If you all remember it was Bill Gates himself that GAVE Jobs a wad of millions about 12 years ago so that Apple didn't fold, and cause him more headaches on the monopoly front. It was simply more profitable for Microsoft to prop them up. What does that say about the management skills of Jobs? Anyway, what used to be the creme of the crop when it came to graphic art and music production is becoming more and more every day, a boutique computer that will become a footnote of names like Amiga(which Jobs also bought and tanked), Commodore, and the Atari 400/800. Which in all honesty is truly sad. <br /><br />So what does the flower child computer genius get himself into these days? Well his latest endeavor with the Ipod and Itunes takes him into his 3rd lawsuit with the Beatles, one which the Beatles are unlikely to back down from or settle out of court this go around, as Apple is not just flirting on the edges of the music business, they are up to their neck in it. Clearly in violation of copywrite and trademark laws. Jobs has been able to finesse over the Beatles and Apple Records by staying along the edges of music, the outcome of this will more than likely be a huge punitive sum to Apple Records, and the name Apple Computer will probably be replaced by Macintosh Computer, which if Jobs had an ounce of a brain, he would have done ten years ago as most people identify with the MAC name quicker than the Apple Computer name anyway... Can anyone here tell me this guy isn't an idiot?<br /><br />Actually, that may not work either. There is a high end audio equipment company called Mcintosh that has been around nearly a century. They make some incredible equipment, if you ever get a chance to hear it, take a listen.. <br /><br />Now taking suggestions for a new name for Apple.... Any ideas?<br />
