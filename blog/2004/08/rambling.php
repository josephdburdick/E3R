          <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> The following post will be mostly stream-of-consciousness and not well thought out, and will be very religious (specifically Christian) in nature. If this bothers you, please read on. If it doesn't, please read on. FSEVN hit a lot of things in his post, many of which I want to respond to. As is often the case, I was initially ready to shrug it off and say "Well, most people don't want to hear my viewpoint, and these sorts of issues are very hard for me to think out and present in a nice essay." Then I realized that's not what this is about, and what I have to say about the multitude of issues raised is just as valid as anything else that can be said. I'm taking this opportunity to stand up and be heard, and hopefully produce some dialogue.<br /><br />The difficulty with any religion is that it is at odds with human nature. I believe this is right, because I find most of human nature repellant—an interest in oneself as the most important person is what leads to the evils we so commonly perpetrate against our fellow man. In that way we ARE weak. We are constantly impelled by our nature, which is to disregard others in our quest for self-fulfillment—we are slaves to it. Slaves to selfishness. Slaves to ourselves. Slaves to sin.<br /><br />Now we can argue until we're blue in the face about the likelihood of a God, invoke all kinds of religious musings, scientific theorems and ideas, philosophical questions, and more to "prove" or "disprove" this issue one way or another. Truth is though, the fact that every person seems to have a voice in the back of their head saying "Hey, you shouldn't do that" even when they DO points to there being a higher morality or law (regardless of where it comes from) than us. I choose to believe that's God, in the back of our heads reminding us how we should treat ourselves and others.<br /><br />Problem is that people have turned that voice, that impelling movement, into a dogmatic system of rules and regulations. Christianity isn't about a checklist of things to do spiritually that you move through and do. It's about a real living relationship with a higher force than yourself and allowing that relationship to change your life and the lives of people around you in a positive way. It's first and foremost about respecting and loving the fact that we are uniquely created individuals put on this planet for a purpose, for its betterment. Secondly its about improving ourselves, fighting against temptations that hurt us and others, and helping others do right.<br /><br />This is where things start to get complicated (and these days, controversial). What your Dad did probably seemed right to him, but there's a big difference between forcing a set of rules and regulations on people and loving and nurturing them to bring them up to do right. I believe I should hate sin, but love people first and foremost. I don't care if what you believe is morally repellant to me, you're still a person, you were still created for a purpose, and I need to respect that.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the Bible isn't irrelevant—truth is that, despite the differences in society's surface, the heart of people hasn't changed much in 2,000 years. We still struggle with the same things (jealousy, envy, greed, gluttony, complacency, hate, etc.), and search for meaning in a world that often seems meaningless. One of my favorite places to go on the web (even before I became a Christian) is <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/">Relevant</a>, because they show that even in a modern time that seems a lot different than the Biblical world, that book still has a lot to say about our condition as people and how we should <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4253">treat each other</a>. Witness this passage from an <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4237">article posted recently</a>:<br /><blockquote>The politics of God and the politics of mankind have never been the same. God does not endorse your political party. God is not some party’s spokesman, symbol or tool, and in no way does He serve as a platform for this planet’s political systems. Nevertheless, there are many Christians who believe putting God-professing lawmakers in political power is going to bring radical social change. They must have forgotten that this method has already been tried. It was called the Dark Ages.</blockquote><br /><br />People are always ready and willing to write off the Bible because it has been used to justify great evil in the past. But is this any different than Muslim extremists using passages from the Koran out of context to justify their violence against infidels? There will ALWAYS be a segment of a belief group that is so blinded by evil that they see it as good, and there will always be manipulators who twist the truth to get it around to what THEY want to say. That doesn't mean that the whole of religion is a lost cause—it merely means that people can be easily lost, which we knew anyway.<br /><br />People have debated God's place in our society ever since it was questioned (which is certainly longer ago than you might think). Bush makes nothing new come to light, it's just that his presidency has been surrounded by more controversy than a lot in recent years, and so the level of dialogue has reached a fever pitch. I don't agree with a lot of his policies, I think many of the things he's done have been foolish, but what I really regret is that his misguided sense of Christian justice has put such an incredibly sour taste in many people's mouths. People are ready to write me off for wearing a cross around my neck before they've even talked to me, assuming I'm like the fear-spewing public figures they've seen.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I've shrugged off politics in general. I believe that God has higher means of achieving his perfect plan than the U.S. government. He's eternal, and our government isn't. All I can do is live my life the best I know how, asking God to help forgive me when I wrong others and do them harm (and asking Him to help them forgive me), and try to show love to people around me. I can't do that by instituting public policy of one kind or another, or worrying about what my earthly government does.<br />

				Cless, and every religious reader out there-- I'm sorry about last night's ramble. You Christians really are getting a bad rep because of idiots like my father and Prez Bush. I feel bad for you guys, really.<br /><br />I just get so angry sometimes when people who think of themselves as officials stand above us in <I>America</I> and tell us how we're supposed to live our lives. They can't tell us how we're supposed to live our lives because of their beliefs; thats fascism.<br /><br />So, as I said before, please excuse my behavior I just had to get some shit off my chest. I am not retorting your argument whatsoever; just saying that you are right and I was just getting shit off my chest. <br /><br />Oh and, unless you're cult-like (like my father) about stating your opinions and views up here you are totally welcome to say what ever you wish man. I do it, and everyone else is welcome too.<br />

				Cless, out of curiosity, who or what, specifically, do you believe is God, and how does this differ from typical Christian beliefs, if at all?  Hmmm... that sounds a little weird... see what you can do with it.<br />
