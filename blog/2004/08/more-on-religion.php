          The real tragedy here is that so many have been pushed away from religion. It really does not bother me when politicians evoke religous beliefs in their ideas and opinions. This nation was founded as a Judeo-Christian Nation. Every relevant document, from the Declaration, to the Emancipation heavily mentions God. Unfortunately sometime in the early 80's, a bunch of these damned evengelists (and damned is the way I feel about them), got the idea that they could use God and the Word to build themselves an empire. We had Jim and Tammy Fae Baker collecting money in the name of God, later to the "shock" or in my opinion, the sheer stupidity of their followers, finding out that these people were spending "God's" money on cars, mansions, plastic surgery, and a number of other decadent endeavors. Then of course we had good ol Oral Roberts. Roberts told us that God wanted us to raise a million dollars for him, or the Hand of God itself was going to remove him from this Earth. I am amazed that his followers who should be so learned in scripture, absolutely failed to see the blasphemy in this man. His request in itself violated the Ten Commandments with it's coveting and vain nature. Well Mr. Roberts didn't quite get to a million, nor was he taken from our Earth for failing to. <br /><br />One of the other things that really drove a spike into people was the whole twisting of judgement by your fellow man and the Bible thumpers who practice it. I have heard people say the Bible forbids judging. This is absolutely false! What the Bible says is that we are supposed to judge. But, we are not supposed to embarass someone by judging in front of people. The idea is basically that if I see someone doing something wrong, I am supposed to take them to the side, bring it their attention, and then leave it alone! There is a story in the Bible about Noah. Noah had gotten drunk and passed out naked in his tent. His youngest son found him and brought the rest of his brothers to see. He told them, look at our father and his drunken nakedness. When Noah found out the next day, he was furious. Not because his son had judged him, but because he brought others to see. One of your responsibilities as a Christian is to spread the word, but once again, you are only supposed to lay it put and then leave the person to come to God themself. Another thing that has driven many away is the ideas of forgivness, or rather what they have been taught they need to do for forgivness. This is something that really has its roots in the old church, the Crusades, etc. I ask anyone here to correct me if I am wrong, but I do not remember anywhere in the Bible where I am told to confess my sins to a Priest, or for that matter, I do not remember reading anywhere that God has ordained any mortal here on Earth to be his middle man. <br /><br />To be quite honest, I am not sure where the ceation of the church is laid out. About the closest  I have seen is when God asks "gather my people". I went to the Cathedral once at about 2 am. I had never been there, and I wanted to see the architecture as the worlds cathedrals have some of the most incredible engineering I have ever seen. The flying buttresses in particular fascinate me. Well I was in there for about a half hour when I came across a security guard who promptly told me I was trespassing and needed to leave. My response to him was that I hadn't realized God hod hours of operation. To go back to the question of forgivness and what needs to be done to attain it, the answer is simply that there is NO requirement other than asking. When Christ was being crucified, there were two other men there with him. One of the thieves asked Christ for forgivness and Christ asked him if he believed in his father. The man said yes and Christ told him he would see him in the kingdom. What did he have to do to be granted this? Not a thing, it isn't like he could climb down and go help a leper. I would say that negates the Catholics idea of penance, wouldn't you? <br /><br />Premarital sex.. another tool used by the Government in the name of God called Catholicism. When you are married, the minister, reverend, priest, reads the vows from a piece of paper placed within his Bible, not from the Bible itself. Once again, if I am wrong tell me, but I do not remember seeing vows in there either. The Bible more or less says to love the one your with, so how does the church condemn, or even define premarital sex. In a nutshell, people are not idiots, and many of them see very clearly how the church is hipocritical, and controlling using fear. The church itself is responsible for pushing people away more than anything else. As we speak, they are continuing this. <br /><br />Now personally I am against Gay Marriage, a topic that was brought up earlier. But I seriously pose this question to ANY AND ALL Catholics here. Let me get this straight, the Church condemns homosexuality.... Oh yeah, unless of course it is a priest raping a little boy, then it somehow ok, it is a sin between them and God and God will take care of it. And I am supposed to have faith in the church for what reason? It is reasons like these and many others that have pushed people away from God, and I say again, that is the real tragedy, that is what makes my heart cry. That is why I think you find most people who turn from God do not turn Atheist as much as they turn Agnostic. We want to believe, we are just not sure what to believe in. I will also ask this question... How do you justify people that would scare you into believing in God? If I am God, I want people to love me because they love me, not because they fear me. Respect from fear is not respect, it is fear.<br /><br /><br />Quick note to Cless. I would partially disagree with the human nature thing. While greed and selfishness are traits that are inherent, kindness and humility are also. How many times have you heard of someone running into a fire, or jumping into a river, risking their life to save someone they have never met? This is one of those thing that we percieve because the bad people muddy the water so much it is hard to see the good people, or even trust them when you do.<br /><br />BEELO... not all of us are like that, my beliefs by no means support my ends. There are those of course that do manipulate their beliefs, and with them you are absolutely right on the money. I am reminded of Clinton a few years ago when a letter to Gennifer Flowers leaked out. In it he said how he had found in the Bible that adultery was acceptable, and oral sex was not sex.... Once again, anyone here tell me if I am wrong, but I simply do not recall that..<br /><br />Oh, I remember now, it was in the Book of Paul, in his letters to Penthouse...<br /><br />Dear Penthouse: I read your stone tablet every month, the fold out etchings are simply wonderful. Of course, I read the articles for the most part, your review last month of sandals and mir was very informative. Anyway, I always read your letters section, and I usually wonder about their truth as these stories never seem to happen to me, but then, just the other day, me and the big JC were sitting around rapping scripture, JC was talking about turning water into a 40, and getting the whole town stoned on one joint, we were also discussing the idea that there was a narc in our midst. I told JC that he should keep an eye on Judas, and he told me not to worry, it was under control. Anyway, as we were talking, this hot disciple came in and......... DOH! Two terms, we actually gave that piece of shit two terms!!!!<br /><br />Peace all, and find your spirituality where you find it. The cool thing about this is that as we look for the meaning of life, it is right under our noses in these questions. The meaning of life is simply...the search for the meaning of life... :-)<br /><i>edited by FSEVN</i>. Reason: Just a few more paragraphs needed. Otherwise, excellent post.<br />
