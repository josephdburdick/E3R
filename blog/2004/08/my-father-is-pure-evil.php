I wish you could trade in your parents for new ones. That way, if I went through with the process I would have come out completely different with different parents and hell, maybe I would have the ability to tan like most people. But no, I'm brazilian, american indian, and polish, and probably a little jewish. Bah, who cares. The point is that I am a very fucked up individual. I might seem okay on the outside, and if you asked me I'd tell you the same, but on the inside I am chaos. <br /><br />And I rightfully blame my god damned parents.<br /><br />Yuh see, my dad is a loser. He wasn't always a loser, no. Once, he was a winner. He had big muscles, full head of hair-- most of the chicks at his school thought he was the hottest thing since flaming <i>shit</i>. But my dad had one flaw: he was easily suseptable to influence. My grandfather, Edward "Ace" Burdick, pushed his ideological beliefs upon my father but never acted upon them. So my father met my mother, did the nasty, and viola here's a tiny FSEVN walkin around pissin on the carpet. When he met my mother he changed a bit, went against his parent's will and married a woman from the wild jungles of Brazil who couldn't read a line out of "Go Dog, Go!" even if there was a gun to her head. <br /><br />I was never really close to my father due to the military. We moved so often, sometimes he would move without us. One time, when my father was living in Connecticut and we were living in the second worst ghetto I have ever had the joy of living in, my dad hit some black ice up north and flipped his car. <br />Ever since that day, my life would never be the same.<br /><br />He became a religious zealot-juggernaut on crack. I know many of you don't believe this stuff but we weren't allowed to eat meat for years, we weren't allowed to watch TV for years-- I had missed out on every single good movie from the year 1995 to 2000. What I really lost was my father forever.<br /><br />He makes me hate religion. I respect everybody who has faith and it doesn't matter which flavor of faith you like to gnaw on but there is a part of me always on the defense. If any of you, doesn't matter if you're my girlfriend or who ever...I don't give a damn who you are but as soon as you make decisions that affect me BECAUSE of religion then not only are you forcing your religion onto my reality but you're also fueling my fire. No one will <b>EVER</b> tell me what to do because a book says so. If you're really so weak mentally to figure out what is right and wrong without a manual then I hope you have a lot of help from you God. Mercy from me you will not receive.<br /><br />The problem with today is that there are many things, many peoples' lives at stake due to politics, religion, and the lack of a difference between the two. "In God We Trust"? Bah, there is nothing to fear except faith itself. It is faith that is the reason for the Holy War that everyone is fighting in. It is faith that causes money to seep to and from the White House. It is faith that keeps us blind just enough to keep the powerful in charge. What is the difference between Democrat's rundown of Big Government and the reality of the Republican's Sheer Might? I see nothing. <br /><br />So my father is up to visit me yesterday. My dad, uncle and I go to see some monuments around DC and everything is fine. We begin (actually my Uncle started it, I generally have nothing to say to my Dad) talking about Politics and my dad went right wing. Thats fine, he has a right to go right wing. But then, as to back up Repubs, he quoted some bullshit out of the Bible. This happens all the time so I sat back as my uncle retorted with something scientific. What's funny is that this is happening all over America, this very thing. Bush calls himself the great "uniter" but its this kinda shit that is dividing the country. Currently, he takes credit for splitting up the country more than the US has ever seen ('cept the civil war). What's wrong with Republicans?? <br /><br />Just wait, I'll answer that question. Can I just say that I was a Republican before all of this? I'm only a newbie Democrat. You know what caused this and many switches just like mine? <b>President Bush</b>. How? THERE IS NO FUCKING DIVISION OF CHURCH AND STATE. WE ARE ALL A BUNCH OF FUCKING WAR MONGLIN' PUSSIES WHO HIDE BEHIND OUR RETARDED-ASS PRESIDENT WHO DOES THINGS UNDER 'GOD'. GOD DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AMERICA ANYMORE. <br /><br />So, my Dad, as crazy as the sonofabitch is, represents a scary portion of the American population. He goes to church, his <b>wife</b> (my mom) is cheating on him and he doesn't know it, his children have no emotional connection to him besides hate, and he plans on voting for Bush. <br /><br /><div hspace="5" align="left" style="margin:0px 5px 0px 3px;padding:3px;width:180px;float:right;background-color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #000000;"><b><font face="verdana" size="1"><img src="http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/15/samesex.marriage/story.senators.jpg" width="180"><br>This man wants to tell you how God thinks the Country should run. Every R-Representive was sent to us from Heaven. Good Lordy!</font></b></div>Church does not have anything to do with State. My father has a fear that once "the Protestants and Catholics gain enough control in the Government that America will fall" and then he goes and votes for the side that is allowing this to happen. This is not propaganda people, you don't have to listen to me, I am not trying to change you. This is a scream, oldschool E3R style. My father is an idiot and there are too many of these walking around the capital. I got off the metro today greeted by 3 police officers in armor holding an AK-47. Oh wait, yeah that information about terrorists? Umm, that was from BEFORE Sept 11th, 2001. THAT TERROR LEVEL IS LATE TWO YEARS. This shit just doesn't make any sense and people are still buying.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and if they do ask me to fight next year in the war (due to 49% of the enlisted not planning on enlisting again next year) I will go and fight with pride. Not pride for the reason, not pride for my President, but pride for myself and for my GOD <u>DAMNED</u> country. I will fight, I will kill the enemy, and, if I do perish, I will not die in vain.<br /><br />Because after all, all I was was just a poor minority anyway. I was made to die for my country. I just want to remind you that my 15 page essay still remains on the left- to assure you that my mind and imagination will be more of waste than my whole, dead body. I dare anyone to tell me that I don't deserve college as much as a white kid from the uptown. I dare anyone to tell me I can't FIGHT like you can. I will tear your argument LIMB FROM LIMB to prove my point. If I am pulled away from college to fight, if ONE more thing gets in my way of my goal I swear to your God I will not be happy at all. I have worked too hard, I have given up too much, to make it to this point and be dragged away. <br /><br />And yes, I did just find out about my mom cheating on my father. <br />
