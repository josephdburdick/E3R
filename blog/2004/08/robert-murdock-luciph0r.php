          Does anyone know who this man is? For everyone who likes Bush and doesn't exactly know why... look up this guy's party affiliation and what he <em>owns</em>.<br /><br /><strong>On another note...</strong> I just wanted to express my feelings a bit about who I am and who we are. I am, we are, Americans. I was, you are, getting fooled into thinking we have small government. I am becoming, you need to be, a political activist until November because there are a lot of weird things going on in the country and as an informed citizen I will do everything I can to show people that things are screwy on the Hill. Robert Murdock owns 3/4 of the world's media sources and he's an extreme Right-Wing politician. 3/4 of the <i>WORLD'S</i> media sources.<br /><br />Screw parties and sides.<br /><br />What is your straight up stance on these issues? Wouldn't you like to know...<blockquote>- truth in the media<br />- the truth about who we're fighting<br />- just how much the church is involved in the government right now<br />- how the economy is doing (screw the Fox filter)...how it's doing in [reality].<br />- where (or who) the tax breaks went to<br />- how many students won't be able to afford school<br />- how many students <b><i>WILL</i></b> resort to getting their education funds from joining the military.</blockquote>Just how many of us gets our opinions from the nightly news? I'm not trying to look cooky here people. Just open your eyes a bit. So John Kerry represents the 'big government' party? You're kidding right? Just rub the sleep out of your view and see how big our government is <strong>right</strong> <strong><u>now</u></strong>.<br />

				- by now, we know about who we're fighting just not why.<br />- we don't know how much the church is involved in politics because the man who owns all of the news broadcasts cloaks it.<br />- the economy is doing poorly (Bush can't even follow a war budget)<br />- we know that the tax breaks went to the top 5% of the people in the US with the highest incomes<br />- less kids are able to afford school due to the budget cuts and tax-break routing<br />- I hope my kids consider military because I can't afford to pay their way.<br /><br />So our country is a little "screwed up". Its not the first time. Kerry isn't any better in my book. He looks like a combination of the Exorcist and the mask from 'Scream'. Anyway, I'm tired of this bullshit war. Let Kerry come in, turn off the war, fix our economy, then maybe we can try and fix those terrorists later. Bush has drained our resources and our soul. <br /><br />Cheney is the devil.<br />

				If you don't like big government, don't vote for either of the two main parties.  Sure, Democrats are the "big government" party, but the GOP is hardly any better.  <br /><br />The Libertarian party is the one that you probably want, if your in favor of smaller goverment (especially smaller Federal government).  Correct me if I'm wrong, but these are the guys who base a lot of their ideologies on "as long as you aren't hurting anyone else...", meaning you should be allowed to do drugs in the comfort of your own home, if you'd like, and have such programs as Welfare and Medicare be handled by private groups and philanthropy rather than have the government dole out your money in a way that they deem acceptable.  They're just against the paternal, sheltering attitudes of our goverment, basically.<br /><br />Will this party win the election? No. (Did you even know that they had a candidate running?) But maybe the first step to solving the problem of "the lesser of two evils" is realizing that there is a third or fourth which is potentially "least evil".<br />

				Nah, I'll send my vote to a party that will definately stir things up. Sending my vote to the libertarians would be sending my vote to Bush, practically. I'll send it to Kerry who, may very well be a dumbass, but at least we'll give the Gays a chance to live properly and we might be able to negotiate SOMETHING with the rest of the world.<br /><br />The negotiations would probably be something like: "Guys, look...we're sorry. I didn't vote for 'em. Truce?"<br />

				I think the best way to solve the marriage issue is to remove any ties between marriage and the government entirely.  Right now, people get certain benefits or hindrances from their marital status through taxes and similar government regulated things.  Why should the government treat two people who are committed and/or in love differently?  It's like saying dog owners should get tax breaks and cat owners shouldn't.<br /><br />By not letting the government have any involvement with marriage, it won't MATTER if anyone likes it or doesn't like it.  They'll have to let it happen anyway.  Of course, I'm not talking about things like marrying minors or family pets or anything.. somethings still need to be protected, like those examples.  I think this is the Libertarian position on this issue as well.<br /><br />And a word about the Bible Thumping Legislators... if the reason for barring Gay Marriage is that it's religiously wrong, then how can you decide to make laws against it?  Laws born of religion are the mark of a theocracy and the opposite of "separation of church and state".  I'm not sure that this is any lawmakers "official position" on the reason for Gay Marriage to be banned, but religion really shouldn't have anything to do with what is legal, IMHO.<br />

				The reason the church is up in arms about this issue is that the concept of "marriage" which is wholly religious has been used by the government for years to deal out tax benefits to married couples under the premise that they'll likely be starting families. I don't agree with gay marriage, personally, because it validates a behavior I believe to be sin. At the same time, our government divested itself of religious influence years ago, and its likely not going to change. I'd just like to see them stop using the word "marriage" at all. Everything is a "civil union" to get tax benefits from the government—marriage is strictly a religiously recognized union. If you want the federal protection that comes with being married, get civil union papers. It's really about the words, to me.<br />

				Okay, think about it this way Cless. I know that gay marriage is against your religion and that's why you won't vote for it but check it out...<br /><br />What if (just hear me out) there was a religion where homosexuality wasn't just allowed, but suggested? Of course it wouldn't be a branch of Christianity but these people are Americans and these people have a right to freedom of religion.<br /><br />SO...what do you do? Do you vote no on allowing them marriage because it infringes your beliefs or do you vote yes because it is a human right?<br />

				WOAH!!!! That is dangerous ground. When we speak of religious freedom, we are speaking of ESTABLISHED religions. I know that sounds very vague, but you know what that means, so don't go there. Under that thought, NAMBLA(the North American Man Boy Love Association) could decalare themselves a religion, and try to espouse their belief that "consentual" sex between them and little boys is pefectly ok. The bottom line on this issue is this. The people who are pushing this, are FOR THE MOST PART, trying to undermine a religion they despise. They try to use issues to bolster their case, which simply do not hold water. They talk about health benefits, partnership rights, inheritances, etc. None of things are barred from them now, and legalizing this marriage thing will give them NO rights that they are denied at the present time. There is nothing starting me and anyone elses here from buying a house together, starting a business, leaving property to each other, or any other numerous things that say is at the center of their "cause". Right now, I am allowed at my job, to place a "live in, life partner" on my health insurance, or leave them as the beneficiaries of my life insurance.<br /><br />The problem many of us have is that by redfining marriage, you destroy it. What would stop a man and two women, two women and a man, the entire cast of Friends, or all of us on this board from "marrying". And don't say that is a stretch. It is called erosion, and you always have to take it to its possible end as it will more than likely end up there.<br />
