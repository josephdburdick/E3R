          First of all, Tuuk, your post was... a bit long. <br /><br />Secondly, with regards to your comment about my beef with GW going to Yale and myself not being accepted to Virginia Tech:  I just don't like that nepotism was the deciding factor in his acceptance and not his own merits.  You'd think that someone who will eventually be president could get into college on his own or something... I don't know, it's disappointing.  Would I take advantage of the same situation if given the chance?  Yes I would.  But the issue I have here is this (and keep in mind, I really don't know too much about how Yale is funded; if it is completely funded by private means, they are excluded from this):  There is no logical reason why I should have to pay a proportionately equal amount of money to a state-funded university (such as Virginia Tech) when I have a less-than-equal chance of being admitted... which means that no one should be given that "leg up" birthright oppurtunity.<br /><br />Thirdly, I never said I was voting for Kerry, nor did I ever imply that I wouldn't vote for Bush simply because I'm jealous of his getting into Yale.  I believe that I said I would vote for Justice.  And by justice I mean not Kerry.  And also, not Bush.  That's right, Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik is getting my vote, probably.  Zing!  Maybe he isn't the Personification of Justice, but I'm sure he's an alright guy.<br /><br />And as a sidenote, I am definitely not voting for Kerry because he supports the platform of affirmative action, AKA reverse discrimination.  I don't feel very strongly about many issues, but this one happens to be one of the ones that I do have an opinon on.  If anybody thinks that this platform is a good idea, please comment or post.  I'm interested to know if you guys really think it's a good idea or are just willing to bear it if it means that Bush is out of office.<br /><br />

				You are right to be mad. You and I are just as deserving as anyone else, and it sucks! For this reason, I find it disheartening that you will be throwing your vote away. It really will not do anything for your cause. And the idea that some people insinuate, that by voting for a non mainstream candiate, it will push their issues to the forefront is hogwash. Neither party listens to that seriously. Nader has not had any effect on the Democratic Party. In fact, in some states where they control the legislature, they are trying everything to keep him off the ballots.<br /><br />On affirmative action, I wonder if the minorities that benefit from it relaize they really are doing themselves more harm than good, as colleges end up lowering their standards in order to meet a quota. We can and should guarantee and equal opportunity for all, but we can never guarantee an equal outcome. That is left up to how hard the individual works to get there.<br /><br />I am curious Kevin. Did VT give you any explanation? This really is one of those times I wish I was an attorney.<br />

				No, VT didn't give me any information other than "we regret to inform you that we can not admit you at this time," or something like that.<br /><br />You could think of a vote for a third party candidate as a vote wasted, but then again, you could consider any of our votes to be a vote for Bush, since Virginia will almost certainly go to him anyway.<br />

				VA Tech is a PUBLIC state school where as they CARE what is going into the college. Where as Yale is PRIVATE and its process has its biggest sway through Alumni...didn't Kerry go there too?<br /><br />If you are voting Third then why the hell would you only trash one of the three candidates when you should do both since you are voting third....you logic is chaos.<br />

				According to Kerry's website, he graduated from Yale. Funny, the next sentence says he volunteered for service in Vietnam, another lie. He filed for three deferments and was rejected three times, he then quickly joined the Naval Reserves which gave him a 50/50 shot of being called up for duty or not, as Bush also did by joining the reserves as a pilot. Kerry got called, Bush did not. Luck of the draw. But once again, Kerry is not the John Wayne he likes for us to see him as.<br /><br />Anyway, as education goes....<br /><br />George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Harry S. Truman, Andrew Johnson, Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Andrew Jackson, Millard Fillmore, and Zachary Taylor.<br /><br />None of these Presidents attended college or for that matter had any formal education past their general education. Most of these men became fine leaders. I myself did not attend college. I will not mention my GPA, but it is lower than almost everyone you know in school, and would hope you would not question my intelligence. While I would not say I am Einstein, I am sure I know a hell of a lot more than some of the idiots I work with, who have four year degrees. The fact of the matter is education in America in the 20th and 21st Centuries has little to do with actual knowledge. How many people do you all know, who maintain good grades, but you wonder how they tie their shoes in he morning. I will also guarantee you that while a certificate of education may get your foot in the door, once you are there, only hard work will earn you promotion. I would be lying if I said I don't chuckle under my breath at least a tiny bit, every time I have been promoted over someone with a four year degree.<br /><br />Check this out.. Abraham Lincoln is considered by nearly all historians to be the greatest President in our history, and even by some to be one of the greatest leaders the world has ever seen. He taught himself to read, and carried himself and his family from poverty. He failed miserably over and over again, but he never quit. He even had a nervous breakdown at one point.<br /><br />1831 ‑ 22 yrs. ‑ defeated in business <br />1832 ‑ 23 yrs. ‑ defeated for the house<br />1834 ‑ 25 yrs. ‑ failed in business<br />1834 ‑ 25 yrs ‑ He was elected to the Illinois State 1836 ‑ 27 yrs. ‑ nervous breakdown<br />1836 ‑ 27 yrs. ‑ Elected to Illinois House.<br />1838 ‑ 29 yrs. ‑ lost an election<br />1840 ‑ 31 yrs. ‑ Elected to Illinois House.<br />1842 ‑ 33 yrs. ‑ Elected to Illinois House.<br />1843 ‑ 34 yrs. ‑ lost congressional race<br />1846 ‑ 37 yrs. ‑ ran for office and lost <br />1855 ‑ 46 yrs. ‑ lost senate race<br />1856 ‑ 47 yrs. ‑ unsuccessful in his bid for the vice presidency<br />1858 ‑ 49 yrs. ‑ lost senate race<br />1860 ‑ 51 yrs. ‑ became President of the United States<br />

				A comment on third parties. I have been hearing for a while that we need more than a two party system. If you simply look at other nations that have this system, you can easily see the disaster it could lead to in this country. Basically, we use a Primary System and a General Election with an Electorate system for a reason that makes a lot of sense. <br /><br />Take for example a country like Spain, Italy, or France. They are all small countries, in such, there really are no as many opposing views as there are here, and you certainly do not find the nutcase fringe groups the way you do here. In these countries, they will have say a six way election. When the votes are counted, if their is a clear winner, then it is done, he is sworn in and life moves on. However, if it is too close to call, they will take say the top two candiates and have a run off election, with the winner of that vote taking the prize. This works fine there, and we even use this procedure in State and county/city elections here.<br /><br />The problem with using this system in a country with hundreds of millions of people is quite simple. Say we have six candidates running. four of them are fairly sane middle of the road guys, two each slightly left and right of each other, and then two VERY extreme right and left candiates rounding out the six. There is a very good possibility that the voters on both sides could end up splitting their votes around the four candidates, say 15% each, 30% for each party, while the two far extreme candidates end up splitting the remaining 40% between them. This would trigger a run off between the two extremists, and suddenly we are faced with a choice between to nutscases. We will say for arguments sake, that one of the two isn't quite as crazy, and the country slides over to him with say 60% of the vote. It would appear as if he recieved a landslide victory. This of course would not truly be the case. Now we would be left as an electorate with a fanatical candidate, wishing we had rallied together behind two of the mainstream candidates rather than splitting between the four, as they would have recieved 30% each, knocking the other two with 20% off of the ballot. We have our primary system as that is our lead up to the run off in the General Election.<br /><br />This also is why our Nation is NOT NOT NOT a pure Democracy. We are a Federalist Republic, and the reason for this is very simple, and very logical. Although we do govern ourselves, the Forefathers, in VERY GOOD WISDOM, built into the Constitution protections against us directly making policies as a people. We have the Legislature who writes our laws, the Executive Branch that signs and PRESDIES over our laws, and the Judicial that decides the Constitutionality of these laws. The reason is very simple. Say we all have little voting boxes in our house, like some suggest we should have. Tomorrow, a nuclear bomb or Nucyalur as GW would say (did you like that one Kevin? LOL) say one goes off in NY, and all initial evidence points to Russia as the culprit. Well the reponse to a nuclear attack on this country will be a nuclear counter attack. So the vote is put to the people directly, we all hit our yes button out of sheer anger, the ICBM's launch, and poof WWIII. We then find out a couple of days later that oops... we were wrong, it wasn't Russia.. OH FUCK! So in a Federalist system, we elect leaders, and entrust them to make these hard decisions after well thought out deliberation. It is that simple.<br />
