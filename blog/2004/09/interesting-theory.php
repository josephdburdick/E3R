				well if you took into account that the US Gov't actually shot down the commercial plane in PA then it really makes you wonder as to where a missle of this caliber could come from. I know cruise missles are big but who really has artillery like this besides us? <br /><br />A missle that doesn't explode until that last wall...its just strange.<br />

				A lot of missiles are specifically designed to punch "neat little holes" through heavy armor, via shaped, focused payloads.  For instance, when you see an anti-tank missile hit a tank, you see a big ole ball of explosion on the outside.  What a lot of people don't realize is that this is only a small amount of excess kapowza, while the real damage is being done by the fine beam of heat that goes right through most tank armor with the intention of killing the crew with the molten metal and other things that bounce around inside.<br /><br />What I'm saying is that I don't know what shape airplanes explode in, but I wouldn't be surprised if the tubular shape of the fuselage and the speed of the craft would allow for this same type of focused explosion.  This way, there could be a large outer explosion and a slim, fairly neat explosion which penetrates much further.  I suppose the explosion would look sort of like a Tootsie Roll pop, with the candy part being on the outer rim of the structure and the papery stick extending in farther.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm not convinced it was a missile.  Also, I didn't watch the whole thing, because it was set to crappy techno and nu-metal music.  I hope the Tootsie Roll Pop analogy helps explain what I'm a-sayin'.<br />

				Okay guys, the Hitler audio and emotional music is a great touch. I will ask you the same question I asked this person and some of his conspiracy nut friends when he started spewing this shit over a year ago. Explain to me how MULTIPLE people I know saw the plane fly over, witnessed it clip a few power lines on its descent along Columbia Pike, before it hit the Pentagon? He of course could not explain this and actually put forth an underhanded accusation that I am part of the conspiracy, and was posting on his site to simply add to the confusion. <br /><br />If anyone here has ever looked out the window while riding in a commercial airliner and noticed the wings shake, or felt vibrations, or for that matter, understands basic engineering concepts, they will understand that you do not build airliners too rigidly. You WANT them to bend and give so they do not shake themselves to pieces, it has to do with elasticity. It is the same reason wooden rollercoasters and earthquake resistant buildings have play in them. Fighter jets are a different story, but airliners are constructed in this manner. <br /><br />This guy also must be oblivious to the force of an impact of a plane hitting the ground at speeds of 200-300 mph or more. It did hit the ground right before it hit the Pentagon. I remember when Air Florida hit the 14th street bridge in 81', it wasn't traveling as fast, and the part of the plane that hit the bridge was obliterated. The bridge itself, simply lost a section of guardrail. <br /><br />Of course, ignoring physics, engineering, and basic fucking logic, doesn't make their story or their lives as interesting. The Pentagon was built in 1942, and as the saying goes, they don't build them like they used to. They weren't lying, the Pentagon is built from stone that was quarried from the same place as the Washington Monument. Oklahoma I believe, well the upper half of the Monument, as construction was halted during the Civil War. If my memory serves me right, the National Cathedral was constructed of the same stone, but do not quote me on that. <br /><br />The Pentagon's design consists of concentric circles, and whether they knew it at the time or not, is constructed in a manner that maximized strength in just such a collision. Think of them as crumple zones if you will. <br /><br />It is funny also as his story has changed numerous times from being an F-15, to a Predator remote craft, to a Patriot, to a Cruise Missile, to whatever it will be next week. It was also pretty funny when I asked this question to one of his fellow nuts, the guy replied that he had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned Columbia Pike, which begged the question of whether or not he had ever been to Arlington, or even DC for that matter, and of course he had not been here, and furthermore, he lives in Canada. <br /><br />About the only theory they lay out that I give even an ounce of possibility to, is that the plane in Pennsylvania may have been shot down by our own fighters. This is absolutely a possibility, this would also have been justifiable if it was the case, and the president has already stated that the order was givien to thr F-15's to shoot down anything in the air, civilian or military. But even then, after hearing the phone calls of the passengers that were planning to take the cabin, I think we do them a great injustice by suggesting that they did not in fact, heroically save many more lives at the cost of their own. There has been a temporary memorial placed in that field, with a permanent one to follow. In the military, the highest award possible is the Congressional Medal of Honor, it may only be given to members of the Armed Forces, it is rarely given as it denotes "Bravery Above and Beyond the Call of Duty", and if you know anyone who has servedm they can tell you its importance. The civilian equivelant is the President's Medal of Freedom. Personally, I feel that instead of this crap these assholes are spewing regarding that plane over Pennsylvania, we should be rewarding this honor to the families of every passenger and crew member aboard. I have a two friends from Mannassas that work at Dulles, two of their friends were on that flight, one a pilot, one a stewardess. I had never thought much about the flight crews until they mentioned them to me. Those people, passengers and crew, paid the ultimate sacrfice for us. I do not think I need to lay out what would have happened to this Nation if that plane hit the target we think it was headed for. The Capitol Building with a full Congress in session. We also now know that there were more attacks on the same day in more planes, that for one reason or another did not happen. Thank God!<br /><br />I would say to all reading, to go look at the websites these guys have put together, if not for the fact that we all saw the two airliners hit the Trade Centers, they would probably argue that also. They have in fact twisted that one to their reality and say that those ariliners were armed with missiles that fired off just before the planes impacted. Furthermore, they have argued that the temperature could not have reached the point that it would turn iron and steel into liquid, they argue that the buildings there, specifically WTC7 were set up for previous controlled detonation. Their lack of logic kills me in the fact the simple point they overlook is that nobody has suggested the temperature reached that point. It never had to, it simply had to get hot enough to soften the steel and iron skeleton, where the sheer weight of concrete, office equipment and human beings brought them down. <br /><br />Hmm.. guess that never occured to them. Go to their sites and ask them some of these questions, your posts disappear and the silence of their response is deafening..<br /><br />A little more trivia. The Trade Centers were not the first skyscrapers to be hit in New York. In 1945, a B-52 Bomber hit the Empire State Building at about the 79th floor, leaving a 20x20 ft hole in the side. The plane exploded on impact, 15 people died, and one of the planes engines skidded across the offices, out the other side and landed across the street on the roof of another building. This was a prop plane, and it created a living hell. Add jet fuel to the mix as we saw 3 years ago, and you are looking at napalm hell.<br />
