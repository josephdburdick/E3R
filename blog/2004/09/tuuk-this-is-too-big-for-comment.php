          I'm not aware of Linspire (Lindows) having a 64bit edition at the moment, but Linux itself (the kernel) as well as most userspace programs are fully AMD64, 64bit capable.  My solution would be to install Gentoo, compiled from the ground up for a 64bit environment.  The system you're no doubt thinking of would compile code like a hacker on speed, so the increased time investmest of compiling from source would be minimized.  I'd be happy to do it for you if you live nearby, or do it remotely via SSH.  I set up a 64bit Linux installation with Gentoo for a dual Opteron server at work, so it should go smoothly.<br /><br />The emphasis on law latency is understandable, and running the app within Linux (by virtualization or emulation) may be more trouble than it's worth.  This has nothing to do with Linux, it's the nature of the specialized application beast.  That said, you can custom-compile at least two high-quality PC emulators for Linux (bochs and qemu).  I have used both and qemu in particular can be damn speedy.  However, you might want to consider a dual boot.  Even if you only used Linux for non-audio work, or to back up your files on a more reliable file system, I think you would get good use out of it.  I know even my measily Athlon XP 2700 looks slick in custom-compiled Linux, and that dual Opteron server is a beast.  Here's something that can't be said about Windows (at least an edition you'd purchase in your right mind):  If you go SMP with AMD64, Linux with give you all the NUMA love your motherboard has to give  you.  How's that for the acronym game?<br /><br />Yes, the price on the new Socket 939 processors and motherboards will be prohibitively high for at least the next month.  Although, money must not be dear to you if you're thinking of dual PCI Express 6800's in SLI.  Granted, I don't know much of anything about your work, but even I (a fiend of a hardware geek) think that's too much graphical horsepower for digital audio work.  You'd be much better off losing the Athlon 64 FX and going to dual Opterons.  However, I have yet to hear of a dual Opteron board with PCI Express, so that's another conversation entirely.  I stress PCI Express architecture for two main reasons:<br /><blockquote>1) PCI Express is finally starting to come to market, by Q1 2005 we should see some good market saturation of PCI Express parts.  When that happens, PCI (and to some extent, PCI-X) will become the also-ran.  This is because, despite the long history of PCI and the delay to PCI Express inherent in that history, it is an entirely new architecture designed for high bandwidth and low latency.  One that holds much promise, has been eagerly wanted for years (by efficiency nuts like me), and has been desperately needed for the last two years.<br /><br />2) From an arctitectural standpoint, you want PCI Express.  This is already too long, I 'll just point you <a href="http://arstechnica.com/paedia/p/pci-express/pcie-1.html">here</a> for now. </blockquote><br /><br />I'd be happy to discuss configuration, pricing, and parts lists with you via email if you like.  I draw up parts lists (for machines I'm not going to build) for fun, I pretty much had the server's config nailed within seconds.<br />

				Thanks for the comment, there was useful info there I was not aware of.<br /><br />At the moment, for the purposes I use my PC, Windows is the most logical option for me. Fsevn and I like to go around about Microsoft, but I think both of us agree that our preferences are such as they suit the needs we have. Most of my loyalty to MS is due to my games, and my recording software, Cubase SX 2. I am running WinXp Pro, and the only time I ever have problems, other than the ones I cause myself with my constant obsession with tweaking the heck out of crap, is when I install unsigned drivers. I honestly believe the majority of problems with Windows can be traced back to crappy third party drivers. I think on that front MS has taken a lot of undue heat, and responded well by instituting the driver testing and signing they have. This is by no means an absolution of many of the other problems they have, but from what I understand, Longhorn is going to pretty much be a top down rewrite. Funny, I think I learned the bulk of my knowledge from fucking shit up and having to fix it.<br /><br />I am itching badly for the 64FX chip coupled with the PCIExpress x1, PCIExpress x16 busses, and DDR2 memory. My computer is dual use, recording and gaming, more gaming seriously, as I am too lazy to record often, LOL. When I think of Far Cry and Doom3 on a dual GPU system, leaves my shirt soaked in my own drool.<br /><br />Okay, now you got me! I didn't know what NUMA was, so I looked up and I am even more confused. It sounds to me like as long as I am not running multiple processors, then NUMA is good.<br /><br />I am curious to know why you don't like the NTFS system, I honestly have never had a problem with it, unlike the old Fat16 system. Oh, and the original Win 3.0. In that OS..err dos shell ,if you filled your hard drive, it would start back at the beginning, promptly writing over you boot sector.... DOH!<br /><br />In the end, it looks like waiting is a better option. Since these new standards are requiring new chipsets, it is probably wise to wait until the chipsets are proven stable. I remember even my ASUS board was having a lot of problems that required bios updates when I moved up to the Athlon XP +3200.<br />

				NUMA is actually specific to mulitprocessor setups, and it's great.  The short version is that each Opteron has it's own RAM it controls, NUMA allows Opteron 1 to get to Opteron 2's RAM without asking Opteron 2.  The more processors and RAM banks you add, the bigger the benefit.  It allows a dual Opteron system to have dual dual-channel arrangemnts.<br /><br />-Robby<br />

				That sounds like a great idea. Any idea if it will come into play with the HT type processors. I know they aren't multiprocessors, but they do act like them. Although I guess the idea with NUMA, would require the memory be assigned to the pipe going to its specific processor.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to wait on the major upgrade and instead bought a 250gb HDD and a cold cathode tube and matching fan. Did I need the flashy neon? Of course not, but it gives me one more thing to tinker with. Looking down at it now, I almost wish I still tripped. :-P I was looking at a processor fan but didn't want to pop the $45 for it, my memory has no heatsink and neither the memory nor chipset has any special cooling so I should probably hold back on any extreme overclocking. It sucks though, I really want to update my vid card from the FX5200 I am running, but I figure I should wait until the PCI-Express becomes more widespread.<br /><br />One more quick question. What is the deal with the SATA drives? I was looking at one today and decided to go with the ATA133 drive as my MOBO doesn't support the SATA. I was a little confused though as it was listed on the box as an ATA150, but then on the other side of the box it said something about SATA being 1.5gb/s. Is the 1.5gb/s simply the throughput of all drives on the bus simultaneously?<br /><br />Oh, one more question.. LOL.<br />I just reinstalled WinXP as I like a fresh start on a new drive. I feel like technology is passing me so quick it is hard to keep up. What is RAID exactly. I have read a little, and understand it to ba a redundancy thing. I see there are the different levels, but do not fully understand. With the new drive, I have 3 total. 250GB, and two 40GB drives. So would I be correct in saying that if I put the two 40gb drives in a RAID config, they would basically be clones of each other? And do I really need that on a non server computer?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions, as I said, I haven't been paying attention to the nuts and bolts for a few years. Actually, let me throw this at you. I have been looking for someone to partner up with building and selling computers. It kills me when I see people dropping two grand on a box I could build for a 1/3 of that. I really would like to sell custom machines. I hear people buying these machines and then complain that it does a little of everything ok, but not one thing good. A dedicated gaming box doesn't really do business well, and vice versa. Let me know if your interested.<br />

				NUMA is definitely not an option for HyperThreading.  FYI, "HT" is commonly used for HyperTransport (a bus), HyperThreading is an implementation of SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading).<br /><br />What heatsink/fan were you looking at for your CPU?  I use some Zalmans and a Vantec in my rigs, all are great and cost me ~$30 shipped.<br /><br />Serial ATA (also called SATA, SATA/150, SATA I, or ATA150 [by idiots]) has nothing to do with EIDE/ATA drives of old.  Serial ATA is an entirely new bus that's serial (duh) rather than parallel.  A corollary is PCI Express and PCI.  Because of that SATA drives do not share bandwidth, they each get up to ~150MB/sec.<br /><br />Ah, RAID....this is where it gets fun.  RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks.  Some say it stands for ...<I>Inexpensive</I> Disks, but they're full of it.  You can do RAID with Fiber Channel drives and spend enough to buy a small house, cost has nothing to do with the technology.  RAID's function is determined by which level you use, and I'll outline some common ones for you:<br /><br />    RAID 0: Data Striping - Data is interleaved across multiple drives, improving read performance (and to a lesser degree, write performance).  No fault tolerance exists, data is irretrievable in the instance of drive failure.  At least two drives are needed.<br />    RAID 1: Data Mirroring - Data is mirrored on two drives, making identical copies.  This level is used for complete fault tolerance, but decreases disk performance.  Only two drives can be used (though multiple RAID 1 arrays can co-exist).<br />    RAID 5: Data Striping with Parity -  Like RAID 0, but an additional drive is used to store parity bits for each data stripe (similar to ECC memory).<br />    RAID 0+1: Mirrored Data Striping - Identical RAID 0 arrays are used, one mirroring the other.<br /><br />There are other levels, but those are the most common.  More information can be found <A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fpaedia%2Fr%2Fraid-1.html"> here</A>.  Putting the two 40GB drives in a RAID 1 array would certainly protect you against data loss due to drive failure, but it has a somewhat serious shortcoming.  The two drives would be one logical drive to the operating system, so if you were ravaged by a virus both drives would be equally affected.<br /><br />I'll email you shortly about the custom computer stuff.<br /><br />-Robby<br />

				Ah, did not know that about HT. It is amazing how terms and acronyms are bastardized. DVD originally meant Digital Versatile Disk. Hehe, you think computer acronyms are bad, you should poke around military acronyms. There was a book written a few years back that was something like 1200 pages, nothing but military words.<br /><br />I can't remember the name of it but it was a monster. I did pick up two memory heatsinks today at CompUSA. They are PNY brand, on sale for $9. I have noticed a lack of fans for chipsets also. I personally have fried a chipset or two in my time, although they were both the AMD Northbridge/Southbridge sets, so that could have been why.<br /><br />Yeah, I knew about them being serial, I just wasn't sure about the 1.5GB/s claim. I guess that explains it though, although to upgrade my drive and install a SATA card for a mere 20MB increase doesn't seem worth it to me. It is too bad SCSI has always been such a specialized standard. I have loved the SCSI systems I have owned, the damn drives are just so cost prohibitive.<br /><br />All this talk of drives had me digging in my closet. I have a drive somewhere that is a whopping 1GB SCSI drive. The damn thing is bigger than a power supply and has the wait of a UPS. When you boot up, it sounds like a jet engine as it spins up. An accelerating high pitch scream. I kept it in my systems all the way up to my Athlon Thunderbird just for the looks I got from friends when I started my machine. It is hard to believe I have 768MB of ram, and a 1/3 of a terabyte of disk space. Man, I am thinking of my first box, a Tandy based on the IBM 8080. I had a whopping 16k of ram, and something like a 10MB HDD. I think that box even had a state of the art CGA Graphics system and an ISA Gamecard installed. I still have the card in my closet, along with my 2x burner. Yep, it is still there next to an ISA Soundblaster16 and an ISA Modem. Ooooooooh... LOL I think that is what pisses me off about Steve Jobs the most. Even with that box, I always dreamed of an AppleIIc, and couldn't wait for my 6th period computer sciences class to mess around with one. I used to piss my teacher off with..<br /><br />10 Print "DC harDCore Another State of Mind"<br />20 goto 10<br /><br />LOL, the rebel skinhead programmer, go figure. I honestly think I quit programming because of my difficutly with hexidecimal numbers. My sister's husband Dennis, J's uncle, sat me down a couple of years ago and had me thinking outside of the Base10 box within 15 minutes, leaving me wondering why math, algebra in particular left me so dumbfounded back then. I seem to do great now. Geometry pissed me off for a long time. It is like I had this logical mind that was constantly arguing with the common sense section of the brain. I saw no sense in writing a 3 page theorem to explain the triangle had 3 whos angles always added up to the same amount of degrees. I get now that it teaches you to again, think outside the box.<br /><br />On the Raid thing and viruses, I get pissed enough the few times an infection has jumped drives. I am going to look over that site when I get home.<br />
