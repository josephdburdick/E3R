          You know, I feel like this presidential election in November is tearing people apart faster than a Cable connection to the internet. I have never in my lifetime seen people so on edge about such a topic. Why? Well, its simple, its not about being 'democratic' or 'republican'...oh no...its a much bigger picture that people don't want to see.<br /><br />This is about ideologies. See, you're either on one side or you're on the other and here are the two sides: Science and Faith. They are both fine I guess, and usually can live in harmony, but the problem with the presidential election is that the reason that people are voting for one candidate or another is a moral decision. These morals are based on very structured ideologies that have existed for thousands of years. What is happening here is that on both sides people are screaming back and forth because the other side (naturally) challenges their ideology, or to be so frank, purpose in life. You can't tell someone to their face that God doesn't exist. You can't walk up to someone and tell them that their religion is a joke. You can't just walk up to somebody, take off their turban, and start stomping it. Not here. Not in America.<br /><br />On the other hand, no matter how much you know about faith and how many prophecies have shown validity over the thousands of years, you can't walk up to someone and tell them that "gravity doesn't exist, it is God holding each and everyone of us down to Earth". That's clearly not scientific. While I can't prove to you that it ISN'T God holding me down to the Earth, I cannot and will not attempt to understand your logic of thought.<br /><br />So, we have two sides: Science and Faith. Both sides are very powerful and have a very large base (and there are some anomalies in the middle, but let's keep this simple). Now, I see that people <span style="font-style:italic;">say</span> they don't want to talk about it-- try to dodge the subject and yet they really DO want to talk about it. Well...this Presidential Election has caused enough trouble and now I am going to offer a solution-- and as a true democracy we should be able to vote this in and put into effect. Ok, brace yourself.<br /><br />Instead of having a National {$Party_Name} Convention they should be training. Get on a treadmill everyday, learn how to box, Kung-Fu, or whathaveyou. Then, in November when we would normally be voting, we sit at home in front of our TVs which shows a circular dirt road (kind of like a loop). Then the gun goes off and the two presidential candidates ride off on chariots and race around the loop. Whoever wins the race first (or remains alive) is appointed president.<center><img src="http://www.devlogik.com/www/E3R_2/blog/benhur.jpg" /></center>So there we have it people, thats my solution. Start writing promo letters to your Senator........now.<br />

				The differences between leftist ideolgies and the ideologies of the right, have little or nothing to do with faith. Both sides are filled with people who are Atheist, Agnostic, and devout believers.<br /><br />Why the hell do some people seem to still insist that science and faith are somehow contradictory of each other? I can show you TONS of writings J, from scientist that have faith. That statement also suggests that I, by the fact I have faith, somehow do not understand, nor accept science. Einstein was a very religious man, and if you really want to go back, the idea of evolution was actually brought forth by a Catholic Priest who was excomunicated for that "blasphemous" belief, NOT by Darwin.<br /><br />When I hear a Christian say some of the stupid shit they do about God and evolution, I want to pull my hair out. The strongest argument they can ever make to me is that "we were created in the image of God"...DUH! What they are missing in that statement, if they would simply take it step or two further, is this. God is not of the flesh, when the Bible says we are created in the image of God, it is speaking of our soul, not our skin and bones. It is a similar argument I hear from racists that get on people from different races falling in love and having children. Well let me see here, by your thinking, that it is a sin somehow in the eyes of God, don't you think then, he would have made it so we couldn't breed? I think maybe there is an EVOLUTIONARY reason that the hotter the climate of the habitants, the darked they are...Hmmm Believe me J when I say I agree with you on the stupididty of these people. The funny thing about Christian Racists to me, is that their SAVIOR, according to scripture had flaxen hair and olive skin. So if these idiots are right, it is them, who are not in God's favor. My stepmother feaked out J, when Laurie(white) got married to Laru(black). She said some shit about the Bible, when I cut her off with the statement I just made, she ocuntered with this.... "well all the pictures I've ever seen".... I am so happy at times that in her being my step mother, I share no genetic material... LOL<br /><br />Now, on the other hand, you have the pure evolutionists who say science disproves God... Hmm.. how is this? "Well you see, we have the Big Bang".....Wait! It is God....BANG! That is the funny part, a scientist con no more disprove God, than they can prove God's existence. Personally, I bleieve Adam & Eve were cavemen, and we are their evolutionary children.<br /><br />I fully believe in science, and I fully believe in God. I fully believe in creationism, and I fully believe in evoulution. Why is it that people think the two do not exist together? One reason is the myth that we evolved from lower primates. I think that is garbage! Now on the surface J, you are thinking "see, that is the point" It isn't though. I do not doubt that ALL creatures have evolved on this planet. I can see evolution all around me. One of the easiest indicators is the structure of the human body, specifically height. 6 feet is the norm for a man now, where it was 4-5 feet, thousands of years ago. George Washington, and his 6 foot stature was a giant of a man, and that was merely 200 years ago. This is one of many indications you and I can see in a tengible form right before us. The irony is, it is the whole chimp to human theory that freaks out the non believers of evolution. Well we have found now that CroMag and Homo-Erectus primates evolved parallell to each other, not from each other, there is also very strong evidence now, that as the Homo-erectus man moved southward into France, Spain, and Italy, that more than likely they cross bred with the Cro-Magnon man, absorbing them into what we are now, as opposed to the old theory that Homo-Erectus killed them off. It is this logic that is bringing MANY in the science and anthropology community to believe now that we have evolved alongside chimps, and not from them. The question for scientists, and the argument used by creationists has always been that we have no missing link. It isn't even a matter of a link being gone, their simply is half the damn chain missing in biological terms. We can see the evolution of all other primates, we can see the evoultion of ourselves, butthen suddenly there is a leap from chimp to man that is staggering. Hell, maybe the chimps were God's first try, and by the time he got to us, he said fuck it and went on to populate some of the other worlds... That one also kills me... How can anyone with even the slightest bit of logic, look into the sky at night and even have a shred of doubt there are others? I simply do not think we are so damn special that God put us here and then quit... :) Then again, after seeing the stupid things we do with our free will he may have said fuck that shit.. LOL<br /><br />Bascially, it drive<br /><br />Furthermore, as to your statement about these ideologies existing for thousands of years....Yeah...that is the point. In the 60's, we fell on our face as a nation. This was for the simple fact that we forgot about those thousands of years. The counterculture of that generation saw a ton of things that were wrong, racism, sexism, violence, etc. For very noble reasons, they fucked our society in ways we still feel very much today. Their mistake was simple. Rather than simply fix the things that were broken, they chucked the entire rulebook out the window, not realizing that the bulk of our values, our civilized human values, were thing we had developed over thousands of years, through trial and error on our march toward civilization. Slowly as a people, as we watch our skyroceting illigitemacy rates, crime, and every other misdeed, we are starting to realize this, and we are starting to try and reclaim the rules that did work, and meld them with the rules that we fixed.<br />

				I don't think that the idea of the existence of a God is contested by science-types so much as all of the specifics listed in the Bible.  There are a lot of things such as the Tower of Babel or Noah and his ark that there is no conclusive evidence of, which tends to undermine the legitimacy of the Bible as a whole.  Anyway, the existence of one God is not the same as the existence of the Christian God.  <br /><br />While it's true that there are quite a few prominent scientists who believe in God, there should be a distinction made that they are not necessarily Christians.  Research how many Nobel prize winners believe in Creationism... they generally consider it laughable.  Just sayin'.<br />
