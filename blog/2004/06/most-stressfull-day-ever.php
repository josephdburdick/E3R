          I woke up today not feeling any more healed than I was yesterday. The illness lingers.<br /><br />So, it all started with that god damn letter I got this morning from my sister. That was nice. I haven't even had enough time today to think about it rationally and answer her. All I <em>could</em> think about, however, was how royally fucked up my family is.<br /><br />Then, my morning routine was ruined by my PDA not playing mp3s (not turning on at all). It's charging now so it's not broken or anything but that set me back 2 luxury points. Then, on the metro to work I stood by a man who was very well dressed but had horrible body odor. The girl who stood next to me, in nice business attire kept thinking it was me who stunk; probably because of my wild crazy curly hair. Screw her, I'll never see her again anyway.<br /><br />During work, I found myself ahead of the game at such a substantial distance that no one had me do <i>anything</i> all day. At the end of the day (1 hour early so I could run some errands) my boss and I compared DC to Marvel movies and comics. Turns out he's a DC guy-- more power to em but umm...everyone knows Marvel is better. I didn't know there is a <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/ff/">Fantastic Four movie coming out in 2005</a>.<br /><br />So I leave work early coming to the conclusion that you have to be really fucked up to read DC comics. I get on the metro, take it to Courthouse, get my ticket clipped for the ride, head up to vehicle registration where I meet this woman who was very nice. I simply opened up the envelope I was going to send them and gave her the items that were inside. She had me sign a couple things and I almost thought it was going to be that easy but then she told me to go to another window across the hall.<br /><br />I walk across the hall, nobody is in line. Nobody is in line, and yet it still takes me 5 minutes to be seen by someone. A middle-aged woman waves her hand for me to come in her direction. I hand her the things that the first woman gives me and she says to me:<blockquote>Woman: wait, you have a parking ticket?</blockquote>Which, technically, I did. But I explained the situation.<blockquote>Me: Yeah, see I had my parking permit on my dashboard but they gave me a ticket anyway. So, we wrote to the county and haven't heard anything back yet.<br />Woman: When did you send out your letter?<br />Me: almost two weeks ago.</blockquote>So she tells me to discuss this with the man standing at a window down the hall.<br /><br />I walk down the hall where the man is fidgeting in his chair (I don't blame him- sitting in front of an invisible wall would do the same to me).<blockquote>Man: Yesss SIR, whAt caN I do for you?<br />Me: Umm, I would like to discuss a parking situation with a deputy. Are you who I need to speak to?<br />Man: Who told you to see me?<br />Me: the woman down the hall.<br />Man: Well of course the woman down the hall told you to come over here, they always do.<br />Brain: Breathe in Joe...*sigh* DEEP BREATHS JOE!<br />Joe: SO *gritting teeth* what can we do about this?<br />Man: Well you can pay your ticket and then sign for registration.<br />Joe: But I didn't do anything <i>wrong</i>. I don't want to pay 65$ for something I didn't do.<br />Man: You had a parking pass disp--<br />Joe: Displayed on my dashboard. Wasn't expired, wasn't hidden, I wrote a letter to the county to get this figured out.<br />Man: Do you have a copy of this ticket?<br />Joe: No, I do not, sorry.<br />Man: Do you have a copy of this letter?<br />Joe: Why would I?<br />Man: See, we can't allow you to register without paying for the ticket.<br />Joe: but I'm taking care of the ticket.<br />Man: *clicks at computer* It's not that ticket thats keeping you from registerring. Its the one you got 2 days ago.<br />Joe: TWO DAYS AGO?!? I have another one?? So, I can't register because I have a ticket because I'm not registerred. Even though I have the proper identification and I'm not doing anything wrong I NEED to pay 65$ JUST SO I CAN REGISTER MY CAR TO KEEP THIS FROM REOCCURING?<br />Man: *laughs* Yes.</blockquote>So, long dialog short, I had to plead guilty by paying 65$ upfront for the ticket and THEN I didn't even get to register! <br /><br />I left that Courthouse a very unhappy camper.<br /><br />So I get home, make a bazillion phone calls to find Meaghan Foster, a REALLY good friend of mine from middle school and I finally found her and then my cell phone dies. So, I decide to take the movie rentals back. I followed my Uncle's directions there and they weren't that bad. Took me about...oh i dunno...10-15min to get there. But how long did it take me to get back?<center><h1>3 AND A HALF HOURS</h1></center>No one in the DC metro area knows a god damn thing about the DC metro area because they are always new residents. That just shows you how many people are migrating to this area from other parts of the country and the rest of the world. One of these days, DC is just going to pop like a mosquito that drank too much blood.<br /><br />I drove ALL THE WAY AROUND <strong>THE BELTWAY</strong> today coming back from Blockbusters. I was cursing like a sailor, punching my steering wheel; SO PISSED OFF because it was all so much bullshit. While I was in <u>Maryland</u> asking for directions, I looked at the food they had and I was so hungry but I had no money.<br /><br />But anyway, I'm so pissed off and tired that I don't even want to finish this post. Fuck it and every mother f'er who gave me shitty directions today. Burn in Hell, allaya's.<br />
