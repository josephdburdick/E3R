This is where I say SCREW THE PC I'M MIGRATING.  Because of my recent change in major I will be getting some assistance from my family to get myself a new computer. Currently, the fastest machine I have is a 1.4ghz Athlon with 128mb video card and 768mb of ram.  <br /><br />This new G5 will spank my old machine and then tell it that it has no father.<br /><br />First of all, the speed of the Front Side Bus (The bus via which a processor<br />communicates with its RAM and chipset;) on the mac will be as fast as the cpu in my main machine: 1.4ghz. the chip<u>s</u> in the mac will be 2.5 ghz each with 1 gig of ram to back it up. The video card is to drool over: a 9800XT pro with 256mb of SDRAM built in (twice of my other computer). The best part: Apple is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com">rumored</a> to be upgrading their displays.<br /><br /><center><b>[IMAGE KILLED]</b><br />imagine this beauty sitting on your desk, 20 inches of pure sex.</center><br /><br />And all this time you thought E3R was made with a mac.

While some <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3571774">people</a> are a little pissed off about not getting the dual 3.0 updates promised by Steve Jobs last year for this year, they might just forgive him when they take one of these new displays for a spin. The sizes for these suckers start at 20" and end at 30". While I think 30" would be overkill, 20" would do me fine. I know there are a lot of Mac-haters out there and I'm waiting for them to show their <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3572669">faces</a>. <br /><br />My <b>BOLD</b> prediction: While I don't think that Apple will be on top, I certainly don't think Microsoft will be the world's number one desktop operating system by 2008.<br /><br />

				This is Robby, decided not to bother with yet another login to remember.  Here's my two cents, delievered with my usual reagard for punctuality.<br /><br />Have you already ordered your new fruit?  On your decision to migrate...what exactly are you migrating from?  Microsoft software?  The x86 architecture?  Open platfrom computing?  I'm by no means shooting down your decision, I'm just interested to know the reasoning behind it.  When I became lusty for Mac-dom, I quit just before buying time after deeper consideration (though, as you know, that could apply to any of my decisions).  I didn't buy a Mac because I didn't want to: pay the price premium, buy a proprietary machine, or buy into a commercial UNIX.  You can still run Linux on the box (check out the Gentoo-PPC64 project) though.<br /><br />Whereas you know me mostly as a Linux enthusiast, my first love is hardware.  I sincerely recommend you do not buy a new Mac unless it's based on a PCI Express expansion bus architecture.  From what I've seen thus far, Apple is going with PCI-X (aka PCI Extended) for their new expansion bus.  This is only a stop-gap solution, I strongly suggest not putting money into it unless you're building a server.  I have just two more bits, I'm sure you're already tired of hearing this.  <br /><br />First off, don't be impressed by the high FSB clock speed.  The Front Side Bus is defined as the bus between the CPU and the Northbrige controller chip (specifically the memory controller).  The G5 has a built-in memory controller, and thus has no FSB at all by the traditional definition.  The FSB of a G5 will always be half of its clock speed (in this case, 1.25GHz) because that rating is actually the rating of its internal concurrent HyperTransport bus.  If you remember back in the days when a CPU's L2 cache was half-speed relative to the host processor, the calculations work roughly that way.<br /><br />Secondly, be extremely wary of any new large displays from Apple.  Chances are, the statistics of "dead pixel" formation will be even less in your favor.  Your best bet is to go for the smallest display in the new series, as it will have all the design improvements necessary to minimize dead pixels on the large displays without putting near the stress on the implementation.<br /><br />As ever, I hope all goes well.<br />

				While I appreciate your concern, I'm most DEFINATELY sure I'm ready for a change. I run Windows, I run Server machines, it's time to go back to my roots man. Furthermore, my major suggests using a mac. <br /><br />FSB = not important? beh, I beg to differ. I understand that Macs use sort of a Virtual FSB but with the speed at which the real FSB runs, I'll be running with a high ceiling. SO I'll never peak 100% cpu usage -- is this a problem? HELL NO.<br /><br />About the dead pixel problem: yes, unfortunately for PC users that IS a problem but I will have AppleCare backin me up. I don't plan on going too large, a 20in will suffice. Since I'm putting up so much money for a computer I might as well get one that will still be kickin by the time my little sister gets into college. I have 5 machines, most of them running linux, I love linux, don't get me wrong, but its time for something new.<br /><br />Besides, I'll be running UNIX anyway. The only difference is that my hardware will be worth twice as much as everyone elses after their hardware goes obsolete. Think of it this way, it's like I'm running a server box with the K Desktop Environment except Aqua is so much better. <br /><br />Its like that quarky little song: "I can do anything you can do but better!" *whistles* yeah, because I will and I'll look better doing too. When it comes down to it, there are no machines that act and feel as a mac. You can theme and mod a PC all ya want, but in the end you're only digging yourself a hole with CPU usage. Whats the friggen point? So, in conclusion here are my reasons for wanting a kick ass machine:<br /><br />1. I've wanted one for over 2 years<br />2. My major is *almost* forcing me to get one (I could be a pain in the ass and reject their wishes but why the hell would I do that?)<br />3. I've become pretty savvy at every other major OS<br />4. My main machine (1.4ghz Athlon 128mb ATI 9600 160GB w/ 768mb DDR) is slowly becoming obsolete and the Windows install is slowly landing on it's knees from all of the worms and virii I've been dodging.<br />5. Windows is boring and when you have 2 servers Linux gets boring too.<br />6. I'm not a computer scientist. I'm a designer. A designer who has been designing for SEVEN years on a PC. I f***ing DESERVE a Mac by now. <br />7. Just Because. Ha.<br />

				Hello,<br /><br />we don't know each other, but i happened to run by your enthusiasm for Macs. Pardon the intrusion, but i would like to set a couple of points straight:<br /><br />1) PPC processors have never been, and never will be, faster than the x86 standard. The only processor that the G series can be faster than would be a VIA chip. PPC instructins are not meant to handle large bytes of code, nor is it meant to do bit calculations (much like the ones needed to run an OS or Office Software).<br />Since you are a design major, i can see that you are falling for "mac's are best for graphics work" argument. This is sheer wishful thinking. Of all the processors, AMD is, by far the most graphic capable chip. A few simple whetstone/drystone tests, and some photoshop filter timings will prove this quite handily. AMD wins in all but two filters (not the complicated ones either). PPC beats it by a very slim margin in both. Secondly, 99% of all graphic apps cannot make use of two processors, so why have them?<br /><br /><br />2)You are correct, Mac screens, generally speaking are the best. However, i can name a Sony that gets even higher marks, and will save you $1000 or so.<br /><br />3)FSB does not exist when there is an onboard memory controller. Period. "Virtual FSB" is pure marketing langauge. Only a fool would try to imitate/facilitate hardware level communication with an OS. Also, FSB has little to do with actual CPU utilization. Threads are controlled by the OS, and queues are handled seperatly from the core.<br /><br />4)the video cards/sound cards in Macs are not the same as in PC's. The coding is entirley different. Performance levels are different as well. Nor will an extra 128MB of vram yeild any decent performance boost. Also, gamers cards are not meant for graphics work; they misplace pixels. If you want a performance increase, you need to be looking at Qurado 4's, Fire GL's, Matrox, or Wildcat.<br /><br />5)Mac's may be prettier than PC's but they have recently had major design flaws, causing board failures, and terrible case stress. Apple refused to fix or even acknowledge the problem until a year later, after a mass demonstartion was held. Besides, there are plenty of PC's that imitate Apple's beauty.<br /><br />6) OSX is not UNIX. Darwin is based on BSD, which is derived from UNIX. Futhermore, you will never see it, as Aqua has nothing at all to do with the base OS. While intuitive, all of its features, design quirks, and eye candy, can be easily reproduced by Linux or even Windows XP. <br /><br />7) Mac hardware is nowhere near the level of excellence that PC hardware is. You speak of value; Mac cannot retain value becuase of software advances. A well designed PC will outlast and outperform a Mac 100% of the time. Not to mention the upgradeability. ALso note, that apple uses Class B ram, and Class C boards, same as every other retail. How's that for "well built"?<br /><br />8)100% of Mac software runs in Windows/Linux, or has an exact equivalent. <br /><br />In short, there is entirely no reason to buy a Mac. Its a tremendous amount of money, in return for pretty, long lasting hardware; a rock solid OS, with pretty eye candy, yet is ultimatly useless or entirley outmoded.<br />
