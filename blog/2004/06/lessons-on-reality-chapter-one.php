          <i>In which I present a previous view of our universe which seems to be logical, consistent, and rather pessimistic. It is also wrong.</i><br /><br />There is no such thing as free will. The universe has a set path, from beginning, to (potential?) end.<br /><br />Our universe is governed by physical laws, laws such as gravity, newtonian physics, even relativity. For every physical action, there is one, and only one, corresponding reation. If I throw a ball upwards into the air, it will invariably fall. If two ping pong balls strike each other with the same speed and direction twice in a row, then both times they will bounce in exactly the same way.<br /><br />While obviously true for ping pong balls, this governance of the universe by physical laws applies at all levels, from planetary motion to the interaction of individual atoms. A certain chemical reaction, done twice, will twice give the same results. If one could accurately recreate -any- chemical reaction, down to the subatomic level of detail, it would have identical results to its original.<br /><br />Human beings are a collection of atoms involved in a complex chemical reation, and both atoms and their interactions are quite thoroughly governed by rules. Because the bare components of ourselves are governed by rules, then we ourselves are inherently the product of the application of rules. Because we are governed by rules, our current state can only have one possible future state: the state achieved by applying those rules to our bodies.<br /><br />Granted, human beings are -incredibly- complex chemical reactions. Simply knowing the physical laws involved in our constant chemical reaction does not easily give us the ability to predict our set-in-stone future, because there is simply not enough computing power in the entire world, even in the entire solar system, to model so complex a reaction as a human being for any reasonable amount of time. Massive supercomputers have been utilized to demonstrate the exact happenings of a nuclear reaction, but even this nuclear reaction is, compared to a human, ridiculously simple.<br /><br />It would seem, then, that humans are governed by physical laws, even if we are too complex for us to be able to model (and thus predict) our own future. This does not really matter, though. By simply being governed by physical laws, it is proven that even though we could never actually complete the computations required, our future states are still wholly dependant on our past states. Free will, then, is an illusion.<br /><br />Does a computer have free will? Obviously not; a computer is governed in its entirety by the application of physical laws. So much are these laws concrete and unchanging that we have been able to advance our computers beyond what was once ever imagined, because by knowing the laws which govern our computers, we can design more powerful computers to take advantage of these laws. The CPU, once simply a set of circuitry, is now so fast and sensitive that it must be designed with quantum physics. Processor speed limitations are known and explored so well that a modern computer's CPU is limited by the speed of light itself, ie the time it takes for an electric current to move from one side to another of a 2cm slab of silicon crystal. Computers are indeed impressive, but they are just as equally governed by known physical laws. If you knew the entire state of a computer at one point in time, you would inherently know the state of the computer at any point in the future, simply by applying these physical laws.<br /><br />Humans, much as we may dislike it, are simply super-evolved computers. We are governed by physical laws. If we could somehow know every state of every subatomic particle in ourselves, we could therefore predict with certainity ANY future state. Because we can predict any future state, free will must be an illusion! For if we are governed solely by physical laws, how then can we have free will? Free will, it would seem, can only exist if we could somehow defy our physical laws, which we simply cannot do.<br /><br />The educated student, however, will next point to quantum chance, and say "Quantum chance says that we cannot predict what will happen next. Surely this means that in a computer so dependant on quantum chance as the human brain, our futures are thusly unpredictable?" Close, but no cigar.<br /><br />Quantum chance is a byproduct of heisenberg uncertainty, which shows that we simply cannot measure any (sub) atomic event or waveform with enough accuracy to predict its future. This is because, while an electron may have position and velocity, any attempt to measure one of these attributes will, and must, change the other, in a way which we cannot predict. Free will? Almost.<br /><br />Simply because we cannot -measure- both an electron's position and velocity does not mean that it does not have such a position or velocity. Both of these quantities exist for every electron. Suppose we have electron A and B. If we want to measure both A's position and velocity, we would then do so by causing it to interact with electron B, of known position and velocity. By measuring A with a known particle B, we could accurately predict the quantity which would be disturbed by our very measurement of the other. But we cannot do this, because it is impossible for us to know both position and velocity of electron B in the first place.<br /><br />Evidently, we cannot predict quantum events with certainity, because we cannot know all of the necessary information. Thus, the term "quantum chance" is used to denote this inherent uncertainty in our measurement. But simply because we cannot know both position and velocity of an electron does not mean that the electron does not -have- position and velocity. It obviously has both, because both are characteristics of electrons. And because electrons are governed by rules, so are their interactions. While we will never know enough information about an electron to predict the result of an interaction with certainity, we -can- say with certainity that the reaction was predetermined. This is because though we may not know all the imformation necessary to make a prediction, that information still exists, and is still the sole deciding factor in the outcome of a reaction.<br /><br />At even the smallest levels, our reality is governed by rules. Because every component of a human being is governed by rules, so then must be the human itself.<br /><br />We are governed by rules. All chemical interactions in what we call humans are predetermined, no matter whether or not we have the ability to discover all of the parameters involved. Humans are simply giant, complex computers. Like computers, our lives are fixed. Free will does not exist.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br /><i>Or does it? It is the purpose of this series of essays to demonstrate, in a logical, consistent, and provable manner, that free will does in fact exist. Stay tuned for chapter two.</i><br /><br />
