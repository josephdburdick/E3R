          I was thinking about what might be a good topic to post next on E3r, and decided that i'd write about the absolute worst marijuana experience i've ever had.  I realize that marijuana is a very controversial subject and i thought i'd attempt to write something that appeals to both sides of the debate.  So here goes:<br /><br />One boring night during my very first semester at college me and two friends of mine decided to throw in on a huge amount of weed with about 10 other strangers.  I was quite the consistent smoker in those days and jumped at the opportunity to partake in one, huge smokefest.  It took place at a random guy's apartment.  We get there and everyone proceeds to take their seat in a huge partial circle, except for a group of 3 or 4 guys near the kitchen playing what looks like an intense game of poker.  My seat is in the middle of the couch, between the two friends i came with.  And so it begins, and goes on, and never seems to stop.<br /><br />It should be known that i'm a quiet guy by nature.  Not so much when people get to know me, but around strangers or even casual friends i can be very quiet and to myself.  Large doses of weed only make me more quiet than usual.<br /><br />Nobody seems to be doing much socializing during the whole stay i'm here.  The guys in the poker game are so into it that they only acknowledge anyone else when they're handed a bowl.<br /><br />It wasn't a very rich social environment.<br /><br />When i'm faced with moments of silence, i try to think of something to say to liven things up.  When weed's involved, and i'm around people i don't know well, this usually results in nervousness and reluctance.  <br /><br />I've no idea just how long we smoked.  It seemed to go on forever.  Everytime i passed the bowl to the left another one would come from the right.  And so on.<br /><br />After a while, needless to say, i'm incredibly f*cked up.  Things are still relatively quiet, and i'm feeling very uncomfortable.  South Park is on the tv, but i'm so preoccuppied with trying to remain cool that i'm not paying attention to it.  I'm missing a pretty funny episode as i tell myself, very sternly, 'don't say you want to go home, you will look like a complete buzzkill'.  And there was a hot girl at the other end of the couch.  I didnt want to look like a lightweight.  <br /><br />Things get so bad in my mind that i start swallowing uncontrollably, practically every other second.  It seems that i'm suffering from periodic shake outbursts as well, like a kind of chill you get when a cold gust of wind blows by.  "I think i want to go home", i hear myself say, before scolding myself for breaking my promise from earlier in the night.  <br /><br />I could have been suffering from delusions caused by the amount of pot in me, but it seemed like the room had turned against me; that i was some kind of unwelcome kid who just happened to find his way in.  I'm not certain if the guys at the poker table joked about cutting my hair into a mullet or if that was all in my head.  Same thing with the hot girl saying something about me that had me on edge.  I mean it when i wasn't certain, my mind just seemed to keep telling me what i didnt want to hear, i didn't know whether or not to trust it.  <br /><br />Shortly after that, we finally left.  I've no idea how bad i actually was from the outside, but on the inside, it felt like i was having an anxiety attack.  I'm still not sure if what i felt that night was an anxiety attack or not.  Man, was i paranoid as hell though (no pun intended).  <br /><br />Not long after that night i decided to quit smoking for good, following a similar incident that occured a few weeks later, though not quite as bad.  I decided pot just didnt agree with me.  I went almost a year with (barely) any before i started again, but only casually.  These days, when i do smoke, i do it very moderately, and never in large groups or at parties.  I've learned my limits.<br /><br />I've nothing against people that smoke frequently, though i know many people look down on it.  I for one think that it should be legalized, though i don't see that happening any time soon, and that in itself is another topic.  But, let me point out that it does have its benifits.  I truly believe that weed makes people more open minded, expands their interests in music, and makes a person more creative as it helps you to consider ideas in an entirely new light.  <br /><br />I also think it can turn people in to lazy, low income couch potatoes.<br /><br />Yeah, i know.  This was fairly long, and probably not interesting to a lot of people.  However, i posted this because i think this is something people should consider, experienced hippies and wound up conservatives alike.  To help make people more....<br /><br />What was i saying?  Bah!  I need joint.<br /><br />
